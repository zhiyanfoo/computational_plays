Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black : ["Enter - ['BERTRAM', 'COUNTESS', 'HELENA', 'LAFEU', 'ALL']"] : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband. : None
BERTRAM
1.1 :And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death : None
1.1 :anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to : None
1.1 :whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you, : None
1.1 :sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times : None
1.1 :good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose : None
1.1 :worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather : None
1.1 :than lack it where there is such abundance. : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :What hope is there of his majesty's amendment? : None
LAFEU
1.1 :He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose : None
1.1 :practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and : None
1.1 :finds no other advantage in the process but only the : None
1.1 :losing of hope by time. : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that : None
1.1 :'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was : None
1.1 :almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so : None
1.1 :far, would have made nature immortal, and death : None
1.1 :should have play for lack of work. Would, for the : None
1.1 :king's sake, he were living! I think it would be : None
1.1 :the death of the king's disease. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :How called you the man you speak of, madam? : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was : None
1.1 :his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very : None
1.1 :lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he : None
1.1 :was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge : None
1.1 :could be set up against mortality. : None
BERTRAM
1.1 :What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of? : None
LAFEU
1.1 :A fistula, my lord. : None
BERTRAM
1.1 :I heard not of it before. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman : None
1.1 :the daughter of Gerard de Narbon? : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my : None
1.1 :overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that : None
1.1 :her education promises; her dispositions she : None
1.1 :inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where : None
1.1 :an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there : None
1.1 :commendations go with pity; they are virtues and : None
1.1 :traitors too; in her they are the better for their : None
1.1 :simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :Your commendations, madam, get from her tears. : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise : None
1.1 :in. The remembrance of her father never approaches : None
1.1 :her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all : None
1.1 :livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena; : None
1.1 :go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect : None
1.1 :a sorrow than have it. : None
HELENA
1.1 :I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead, : None
1.1 :excessive grief the enemy to the living. : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess : None
1.1 :makes it soon mortal. : None
BERTRAM
1.1 :Madam, I desire your holy wishes. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :How understand we that? : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father : None
1.1 :In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue : None
1.1 :Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness : None
1.1 :Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few, : None
1.1 :Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy : None
1.1 :Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend : None
1.1 :Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence, : None
1.1 :But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will, : None
1.1 :That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down, : None
1.1 :Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord; : None
1.1 :'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord, : None
1.1 :Advise him. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :          He cannot want the best : None
1.1 :That shall attend his love. : None
COUNTESS
1.1 :Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram. : None
Exit : ['Exit - []'] : COUNTESS
BERTRAM
1.1 :  The best wishes that can be forged in : To HELENA : ["To - ['HELENA']"] : BERTRAM
1.1 :your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable : None
1.1 :to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her. : None
LAFEU
1.1 :Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of : None
1.1 :your father. : None
Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU : ["Exeunt - ['BERTRAM', 'LAFEU']"] : LAFEU
HELENA
1.1 :O, were that all! I think not on my father; : None
1.1 :And these great tears grace his remembrance more : None
1.1 :Than those I shed for him. What was he like? : None
1.1 :I have forgot him: my imagination : None
1.1 :Carries no favour in't but Bertram's. : None
1.1 :I am undone: there is no living, none, : None
1.1 :If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one : None
1.1 :That I should love a bright particular star : None
1.1 :And think to wed it, he is so above me: : None
1.1 :In his bright radiance and collateral light : None
1.1 :Must I be comforted, not in his sphere. : None
1.1 :The ambition in my love thus plagues itself: : None
1.1 :The hind that would be mated by the lion : None
1.1 :Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague, : None
1.1 :To see him every hour; to sit and draw : None
1.1 :His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls, : None
1.1 :In our heart's table; heart too capable : None
1.1 :Of every line and trick of his sweet favour: : None
1.1 :But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy : None
1.1 :Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here? : None
Enter PAROLLES : ["Enter - ['PAROLLES']"] : HELENA
Aside : ['Aside - []'] : HELENA
1.1 :One that goes with him: I love him for his sake; : None
1.1 :And yet I know him a notorious liar, : None
1.1 :Think him a great way fool, solely a coward; : None
1.1 :Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him, : None
1.1 :That they take place, when virtue's steely bones : None
1.1 :Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see : None
1.1 :Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :Save you, fair queen! : None
HELENA
1.1 :And you, monarch! : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :No. : None
HELENA
1.1 :And no. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :Are you meditating on virginity? : None
HELENA
1.1 :Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me : None
1.1 :ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how : None
1.1 :may we barricado it against him? : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :Keep him out. : None
HELENA
1.1 :But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant, : None
1.1 :in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some : None
1.1 :warlike resistance. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :There is none: man, sitting down before you, will : None
1.1 :undermine you and blow you up. : None
HELENA
1.1 :Bless our poor virginity from underminers and : None
1.1 :blowers up! Is there no military policy, how : None
1.1 :virgins might blow up men? : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be : None
1.1 :blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with : None
1.1 :the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It : None
1.1 :is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to : None
1.1 :preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational : None
1.1 :increase and there was never virgin got till : None
1.1 :virginity was first lost. That you were made of is : None
1.1 :metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost : None
1.1 :may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is : None
1.1 :ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't! : None
HELENA
1.1 :I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the : None
1.1 :rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity, : None
1.1 :is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible : None
1.1 :disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin: : None
1.1 :virginity murders itself and should be buried in : None
1.1 :highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate : None
1.1 :offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites, : None
1.1 :much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very : None
1.1 :paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach. : None
1.1 :Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of : None
1.1 :self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the : None
1.1 :canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose : None
1.1 :by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make : None
1.1 :itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the : None
1.1 :principal itself not much the worse: away with 't! : None
HELENA
1.1 :How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking? : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it : None
1.1 :likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with : None
1.1 :lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't : None
1.1 :while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request. : None
1.1 :Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out : None
1.1 :of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just : None
1.1 :like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not : None
1.1 :now. Your date is better in your pie and your : None
1.1 :porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity, : None
1.1 :your old virginity, is like one of our French : None
1.1 :withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry, : None
1.1 :'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better; : None
1.1 :marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it? : None
HELENA
1.1 :Not my virginity yet [         ] : None
1.1 :There shall your master have a thousand loves, : None
1.1 :A mother and a mistress and a friend, : None
1.1 :A phoenix, captain and an enemy, : None
1.1 :A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign, : None
1.1 :A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear; : None
1.1 :His humble ambition, proud humility, : None
1.1 :His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet, : None
1.1 :His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world : None
1.1 :Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms, : None
1.1 :That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he-- : None
1.1 :I know not what he shall. God send him well! : None
1.1 :The court's a learning place, and he is one-- : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :What one, i' faith? : None
HELENA
1.1 :That I wish well. 'Tis pity-- : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :What's pity? : None
HELENA
1.1 :That wishing well had not a body in't, : None
1.1 :Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born, : None
1.1 :Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes, : None
1.1 :Might with effects of them follow our friends, : None
1.1 :And show what we alone must think, which never : None
1.1 :Return us thanks. : None

1.1 :Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I : None
1.1 :will think of thee at court. : None
HELENA
1.1 :Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :Under Mars, I. : None
HELENA
1.1 :I especially think, under Mars. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :Why under Mars? : None
HELENA
1.1 :The wars have so kept you under that you must needs : None
1.1 :be born under Mars. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :When he was predominant. : None
HELENA
1.1 :When he was retrograde, I think, rather. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :Why think you so? : None
HELENA
1.1 :You go so much backward when you fight. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :That's for advantage. : None
HELENA
1.1 :So is running away, when fear proposes the safety; : None
1.1 :but the composition that your valour and fear makes : None
1.1 :in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well. : None
PAROLLES
1.1 :I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee : None
1.1 :acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the : None
1.1 :which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize : None
1.1 :thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's : None
1.1 :counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon : None
1.1 :thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and : None
1.1 :thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When : None
1.1 :thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast : None

FIRST LORD
1.2 :                  So 'tis reported, sir. : None
KING
1.2 :Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it : None
1.2 :A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria, : None
1.2 :With caution that the Florentine will move us : None
1.2 :For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend : None
1.2 :Prejudicates the business and would seem : None

FIRST LORD
1.2 :His love and wisdom, : None

KING
1.2 :                  Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face; : None

BERTRAM
1.2 :My thanks and duty are your majesty's. : None
KING
1.2 :I would I had that corporal soundness now, : None
1.2 :As when thy father and myself in friendship : None
1.2 :First tried our soldiership! He did look far : None
1.2 :Into the service of the time and was : None
1.2 :Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long; : None
1.2 :But on us both did haggish age steal on : None
1.2 :And wore us out of act. It much repairs me : None
1.2 :To talk of your good father. In his youth : None
1.2 :He had the wit which I can well observe : None
1.2 :To-day in our young lords; but they may jest : None
1.2 :Till their own scorn return to them unnoted : None
1.2 :Ere they can hide their levity in honour; : None
1.2 :So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness : None

1.2 :His equal had awaked them, and his honour, : None
1.2 :Clock to itself, knew the true minute when : None
1.2 :Exception bid him speak, and at this time : None
1.2 :His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him : None
1.2 :He used as creatures of another place : None
1.2 :And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks, : None
1.2 :Making them proud of his humility, : None
1.2 :In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man : None

BERTRAM

SECOND LORD
3.6 :Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge, : None
3.6 :without any malice, but to speak of him as my : None

FIRST LORD

SECOND LORD
3.6 :I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly : None

3.6 :him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he : None

FIRST LORD
3.6 :O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum; : None

PAROLLES
3.6 :'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost! : None
3.6 :There was excellent command,--to charge in with our : None

FIRST LORD
3.6 :That was not to be blamed in the command of the : None

BERTRAM
3.6 :Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some : None

BERTRAM
3.6 :Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of : None

FIRST LORD

FIRST LORD

FIRST LORD
4.3 :The stronger part of it by her own letters, which : None
