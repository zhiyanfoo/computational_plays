# BECHDEL TEST

""" 
The Bechdel test is defined as follows. It 'asks whether a work of fiction
features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a
man. The requirement that the two women must be named is sometimes added.' 

For this implementation the requirement that the conversation involve something
other than a man is fufilled by the following

1. In a scene the women must not mention any other male characters by name,
when speaking to another women.  

2. they must not mention words relating to male partners.

SEE `create_forbidden_matcher`

3. they must not mention words related to sexual relationships

SEE `create_forbidden_matcher`

In place of whether the two women are named, both women must be in the upper
50% of characters as given by character by importance.  

Note:
    If there are no females in the upper 50% of characters, it retuns 0%.
