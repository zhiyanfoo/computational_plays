DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
1.2 :Why, then, we kill all our women: : None
1.2 :we see how mortal an unkindness is to them; : None
1.2 :if they suffer our departure, death's the word. : None
MARK ANTONY
1.2 :I must be gone. : None
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
1.2 :Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were : None
1.2 :pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between : None
1.2 :them and a great cause, they should be esteemed : None
1.2 :nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of : None
1.2 :this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty : None

MARK ANTONY
1.2 :Fulvia is dead. : None
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
1.2 :Fulvia! : None
MARK ANTONY
1.2 :Dead. : None
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
1.2 :Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When : None
1.2 :it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man : None
1.2 :from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth; : None
1.2 :comforting therein, that when old robes are worn : None
1.2 :out, there are members to make new. If there were : None
1.2 :no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut, : None
1.2 :and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned : None
1.2 :with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new : None

1.2 :And get her leave to part. For not alone : None
1.2 :The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches, : None
1.2 :Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too : None
1.2 :Of many our contriving friends in Rome : None
1.2 :Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius : None
1.2 :Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands : None

1.2 :The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding, : None
1.2 :Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life, : None
1.2 :And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure, : None
