2.4 :Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke? : None
2.4 :Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world, : None

2.4 :Sometime I'll say, I am Duke Humphrey's wife, : None
2.4 :And he a prince and ruler of the land: : None

GLOUCESTER
2.4 :Ah, Nell, forbear! thou aimest all awry; : None
2.4 :I must offend before I be attainted; : None
2.4 :And had I twenty times so many foes, : None
2.4 :And each of them had twenty times their power, : None
2.4 :All these could not procure me any scathe, : None
2.4 :So long as I am loyal, true and crimeless. : None

QUEEN MARGARET
3.1 :Can you not see? or will ye not observe : None
3.1 :The strangeness of his alter'd countenance? : None
3.1 :With what a majesty he bears himself, : None
3.1 :How insolent of late he is become, : None
3.1 :How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself? : None
3.1 :We know the time since he was mild and affable, : None
3.1 :And if we did but glance a far-off look, : None
3.1 :Immediately he was upon his knee, : None
3.1 :That all the court admired him for submission: : None
3.1 :But meet him now, and, be it in the morn, : None
3.1 :When every one will give the time of day, : None
3.1 :He knits his brow and shows an angry eye, : None
3.1 :And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee, : None
3.1 :Disdaining duty that to us belongs. : None
3.1 :Small curs are not regarded when they grin; : None
3.1 :But great men tremble when the lion roars; : None
3.1 :And Humphrey is no little man in England. : None
3.1 :First note that he is near you in descent, : None
3.1 :And should you fall, he as the next will mount. : None
3.1 :Me seemeth then it is no policy, : None
3.1 :Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears : None
3.1 :And his advantage following your decease, : None
3.1 :That he should come about your royal person : None
3.1 :Or be admitted to your highness' council. : None
3.1 :By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts, : None
3.1 :And when he please to make commotion, : None
3.1 :'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him. : None
3.1 :Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted; : None
3.1 :Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden : None
3.1 :And choke the herbs for want of husbandry. : None
3.1 :The reverent care I bear unto my lord : None
3.1 :Made me collect these dangers in the duke. : None
3.1 :If it be fond, call it a woman's fear; : None
3.1 :Which fear if better reasons can supplant, : None
3.1 :I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke. : None
3.1 :My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York, : None
3.1 :Reprove my allegation, if you can; : None
3.1 :Or else conclude my words effectual. : None
SUFFOLK
3.1 :Well hath your highness seen into this duke; : None
3.1 :And, had I first been put to speak my mind, : None
3.1 :I think I should have told your grace's tale. : None
3.1 :The duchess, by his subornation, : None
3.1 :Upon my life, began her devilish practises: : None
3.1 :Or, if he were not privy to those faults, : None
3.1 :Yet, by reputing of his high descent, : None
3.1 :As next the king he was successive heir, : None
3.1 :And such high vaunts of his nobility, : None
3.1 :Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess : None
3.1 :By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall. : None
3.1 :Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep; : None

3.1 :Duke Humphrey. : None
KING HENRY VI
3.1 :My lords, at once: the care you have of us, : None
3.1 :To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot, : None
3.1 :Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience, : None
3.1 :Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent : None
3.1 :From meaning treason to our royal person : None
3.1 :As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove: : None
3.1 :The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given : None
3.1 :To dream on evil or to work my downfall. : None
QUEEN MARGARET
3.1 :Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance! : None
3.1 :Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed, : None
3.1 :For he's disposed as the hateful raven: : None
3.1 :Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him, : None
3.1 :For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf. : None
3.1 :Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit? : None
3.1 :Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all : None
3.1 :Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man. : None

3.1 :Is utterly bereft you; all is lost. : None
KING HENRY VI
3.1 :Cold news, Lord Somerset: but God's will be done! : None
YORK
3.1 :  Cold news for me; for I had hope of France : Aside : ['Aside - []'] : YORK
3.1 :As firmly as I hope for fertile England. : None
3.1 :Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud : None
3.1 :And caterpillars eat my leaves away; : None

3.1 :Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush : None
3.1 :Nor change my countenance for this arrest: : None
3.1 :A heart unspotted is not easily daunted. : None
3.1 :The purest spring is not so free from mud : None
3.1 :As I am clear from treason to my sovereign: : None
3.1 :Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty? : None
YORK
3.1 :'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France, : None
3.1 :And, being protector, stayed the soldiers' pay; : None
3.1 :By means whereof his highness hath lost France. : None
GLOUCESTER
3.1 :Is it but thought so? what are they that think it? : None
3.1 :I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay, : None
3.1 :Nor ever had one penny bribe from France. : None
3.1 :So help me God, as I have watch'd the night, : None
3.1 :Ay, night by night, in studying good for England, : None
3.1 :That doit that e'er I wrested from the king, : None
3.1 :Or any groat I hoarded to my use, : None
3.1 :Be brought against me at my trial-day! : None
3.1 :No; many a pound of mine own proper store, : None
3.1 :Because I would not tax the needy commons, : None
3.1 :Have I disbursed to the garrisons, : None
3.1 :And never ask'd for restitution. : None
CARDINAL
3.1 :It serves you well, my lord, to say so much. : None
GLOUCESTER
3.1 :I say no more than truth, so help me God! : None
YORK
3.1 :In your protectorship you did devise : None
3.1 :Strange tortures for offenders never heard of, : None
3.1 :That England was defamed by tyranny. : None
GLOUCESTER
3.1 :Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was : None
3.1 :protector, : None
3.1 :Pity was all the fault that was in me; : None
3.1 :For I should melt at an offender's tears, : None
3.1 :And lowly words were ransom for their fault. : None
3.1 :Unless it were a bloody murderer, : None
3.1 :Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers, : None
3.1 :I never gave them condign punishment: : None
3.1 :Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured : None
3.1 :Above the felon or what trespass else. : None
SUFFOLK
3.1 :My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered: : None
3.1 :But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge, : None
3.1 :Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself. : None
3.1 :I do arrest you in his highness' name; : None
3.1 :And here commit you to my lord cardinal : None
3.1 :To keep, until your further time of trial. : None
KING HENRY VI
3.1 :My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope : None
3.1 :That you will clear yourself from all suspect: : None
3.1 :My conscience tells me you are innocent. : None
GLOUCESTER
3.1 :Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous: : None
3.1 :Virtue is choked with foul ambition : None
3.1 :And charity chased hence by rancour's hand; : None
3.1 :Foul subornation is predominant : None
3.1 :And equity exiled your highness' land. : None
3.1 :I know their complot is to have my life, : None
3.1 :And if my death might make this island happy, : None
3.1 :And prove the period of their tyranny, : None
3.1 :I would expend it with all willingness: : None
3.1 :But mine is made the prologue to their play; : None
3.1 :For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril, : None
3.1 :Will not conclude their plotted tragedy. : None
3.1 :Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice, : None
3.1 :And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate; : None
3.1 :Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue : None
3.1 :The envious load that lies upon his heart; : None
3.1 :And dogged York, that reaches at the moon, : None
3.1 :Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back, : None
3.1 :By false accuse doth level at my life: : None
3.1 :And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest, : None
3.1 :Causeless have laid disgraces on my head, : None
3.1 :And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up : None
3.1 :My liefest liege to be mine enemy: : None
3.1 :Ay, all you have laid your heads together-- : None
3.1 :Myself had notice of your conventicles-- : None
3.1 :And all to make away my guiltless life. : None
3.1 :I shall not want false witness to condemn me, : None
3.1 :Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt; : None
3.1 :The ancient proverb will be well effected: : None
3.1 :'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.' : None
CARDINAL
3.1 :My liege, his railing is intolerable: : None
3.1 :If those that care to keep your royal person : None
3.1 :From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage : None
3.1 :Be thus upbraided, chid and rated at, : None
3.1 :And the offender granted scope of speech, : None
3.1 :'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace. : None
SUFFOLK
3.1 :Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here : None
3.1 :With ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd, : None
3.1 :As if she had suborned some to swear : None
3.1 :False allegations to o'erthrow his state? : None
QUEEN MARGARET
3.1 :But I can give the loser leave to chide. : None
GLOUCESTER
3.1 :Far truer spoke than meant: I lose, indeed; : None
3.1 :Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false! : None
3.1 :And well such losers may have leave to speak. : None
BUCKINGHAM
3.1 :He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day: : None
3.1 :Lord cardinal, he is your prisoner. : None
CARDINAL
3.1 :Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure. : None
GLOUCESTER
3.1 :Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch : None
3.1 :Before his legs be firm to bear his body. : None
3.1 :Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side, : None
3.1 :And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first. : None
3.1 :Ah, that my fear were false! ah, that it were! : None
3.1 :For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear. : None
Exit, guarded : ['Exit - []'] : GLOUCESTER

KING HENRY VI
3.1 :Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief, : None
3.1 :Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes, : None
3.1 :My body round engirt with misery, : None
3.1 :For what's more miserable than discontent? : None
3.1 :Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see : None
3.1 :The map of honour, truth and loyalty: : None
3.1 :And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come : None
3.1 :That e'er I proved thee false or fear'd thy faith. : None
3.1 :What louring star now envies thy estate, : None
3.1 :That these great lords and Margaret our queen : None
3.1 :Do seek subversion of thy harmless life? : None
3.1 :Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong; : None
3.1 :And as the butcher takes away the calf : None
3.1 :And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays, : None
3.1 :Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house, : None
3.1 :Even so remorseless have they borne him hence; : None
3.1 :And as the dam runs lowing up and down, : None
3.1 :Looking the way her harmless young one went, : None
3.1 :And can do nought but wail her darling's loss, : None
3.1 :Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case : None
3.1 :With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes : None
3.1 :Look after him and cannot do him good, : None
3.1 :So mighty are his vowed enemies. : None
3.1 :His fortunes I will weep; and, 'twixt each groan : None
3.1 :Say 'Who's a traitor? Gloucester he is none.' : None

3.1 :Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams. : None
3.1 :Henry my lord is cold in great affairs, : None
3.1 :Too full of foolish pity, and Gloucester's show : None
3.1 :Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile : None

3.1 :But yet we want a colour for his death: : None
3.1 :'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law. : None

3.1 :The king will labour still to save his life, : None
3.1 :The commons haply rise, to save his life; : None
3.1 :And yet we have but trivial argument, : None
3.1 :More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death. : None

SUFFOLK
3.1 :Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I! : None
YORK
3.1 :'Tis York that hath more reason for his death. : None

SUFFOLK
3.1 :Madam, 'tis true; and were't not madness, then, : None
3.1 :To make the fox surveyor of the fold? : None
3.1 :Who being accused a crafty murderer, : None
3.1 :His guilt should be but idly posted over, : None
3.1 :Because his purpose is not executed. : None
3.1 :No; let him die, in that he is a fox, : None
3.1 :By nature proved an enemy to the flock, : None
3.1 :Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood, : None

QUEEN MARGARET
3.1 :Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke. : None
SUFFOLK
3.1 :Not resolute, except so much were done; : None

3.1 :Seeing the deed is meritorious, : None
3.1 :And to preserve my sovereign from his foe, : None
3.1 :Say but the word, and I will be his priest. : None
CARDINAL
3.1 :But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk, : None
3.1 :Ere you can take due orders for a priest: : None
