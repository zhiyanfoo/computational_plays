FERDINAND
1.1 :Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives, : None
1.1 :Live register'd upon our brazen tombs : None
1.1 :And then grace us in the disgrace of death; : None
1.1 :When, spite of cormorant devouring Time, : None
1.1 :The endeavor of this present breath may buy : None
1.1 :That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge : None
1.1 :And make us heirs of all eternity. : None
1.1 :Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are, : None
1.1 :That war against your own affections : None
1.1 :And the huge army of the world's desires,-- : None
1.1 :Our late edict shall strongly stand in force: : None
1.1 :Navarre shall be the wonder of the world; : None
1.1 :Our court shall be a little Academe, : None
1.1 :Still and contemplative in living art. : None
1.1 :You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville, : None
1.1 :Have sworn for three years' term to live with me : None
1.1 :My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes : None
1.1 :That are recorded in this schedule here: : None
1.1 :Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names, : None
1.1 :That his own hand may strike his honour down : None
1.1 :That violates the smallest branch herein: : None
1.1 :If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do, : None
1.1 :Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too. : None
LONGAVILLE
1.1 :I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast: : None
1.1 :The mind shall banquet, though the body pine: : None
1.1 :Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits : None
1.1 :Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits. : None
DUMAIN
1.1 :My loving lord, Dumain is mortified: : None
1.1 :The grosser manner of these world's delights : None
1.1 :He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves: : None
1.1 :To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die; : None
1.1 :With all these living in philosophy. : None
BIRON
1.1 :I can but say their protestation over; : None
1.1 :So much, dear liege, I have already sworn, : None
1.1 :That is, to live and study here three years. : None
1.1 :But there are other strict observances; : None
1.1 :As, not to see a woman in that term, : None
1.1 :Which I hope well is not enrolled there; : None
1.1 :And one day in a week to touch no food : None
1.1 :And but one meal on every day beside, : None
1.1 :The which I hope is not enrolled there; : None
1.1 :And then, to sleep but three hours in the night, : None
1.1 :And not be seen to wink of all the day-- : None
1.1 :When I was wont to think no harm all night : None
1.1 :And make a dark night too of half the day-- : None
1.1 :Which I hope well is not enrolled there: : None
1.1 :O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep, : None
1.1 :Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep! : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these. : None
BIRON
1.1 :Let me say no, my liege, an if you please: : None
1.1 :I only swore to study with your grace : None
1.1 :And stay here in your court for three years' space. : None
LONGAVILLE
1.1 :You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest. : None
BIRON
1.1 :By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest. : None
1.1 :What is the end of study? let me know. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :Why, that to know, which else we should not know. : None
BIRON
1.1 :Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense? : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :Ay, that is study's godlike recompense. : None
BIRON
1.1 :Come on, then; I will swear to study so, : None
1.1 :To know the thing I am forbid to know: : None
1.1 :As thus,--to study where I well may dine, : None
1.1 :When I to feast expressly am forbid; : None
1.1 :Or study where to meet some mistress fine, : None
1.1 :When mistresses from common sense are hid; : None
1.1 :Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath, : None
1.1 :Study to break it and not break my troth. : None
1.1 :If study's gain be thus and this be so, : None
1.1 :Study knows that which yet it doth not know: : None
1.1 :Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :These be the stops that hinder study quite : None
1.1 :And train our intellects to vain delight. : None
BIRON
1.1 :Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain, : None
1.1 :Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain: : None
1.1 :As, painfully to pore upon a book : None
1.1 :To seek the light of truth; while truth the while : None
1.1 :Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look: : None
1.1 :Light seeking light doth light of light beguile: : None
1.1 :So, ere you find where light in darkness lies, : None
1.1 :Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes. : None
1.1 :Study me how to please the eye indeed : None
1.1 :By fixing it upon a fairer eye, : None
1.1 :Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed : None
1.1 :And give him light that it was blinded by. : None
1.1 :Study is like the heaven's glorious sun : None
1.1 :That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks: : None
1.1 :Small have continual plodders ever won : None
1.1 :Save base authority from others' books : None
1.1 :These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights : None
1.1 :That give a name to every fixed star : None
1.1 :Have no more profit of their shining nights : None
1.1 :Than those that walk and wot not what they are. : None
1.1 :Too much to know is to know nought but fame; : None
1.1 :And every godfather can give a name. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :How well he's read, to reason against reading! : None
DUMAIN
1.1 :Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding! : None
LONGAVILLE
1.1 :He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding. : None
BIRON
1.1 :The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding. : None
DUMAIN
1.1 :How follows that? : None
BIRON
1.1 :                  Fit in his place and time. : None
DUMAIN
1.1 :In reason nothing. : None
BIRON
1.1 :                  Something then in rhyme. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :Biron is like an envious sneaping frost, : None
1.1 :That bites the first-born infants of the spring. : None
BIRON
1.1 :Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast : None
1.1 :Before the birds have any cause to sing? : None
1.1 :Why should I joy in any abortive birth? : None
1.1 :At Christmas I no more desire a rose : None
1.1 :Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth; : None
1.1 :But like of each thing that in season grows. : None
1.1 :So you, to study now it is too late, : None
1.1 :Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu. : None
BIRON
1.1 :No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you: : None
1.1 :And though I have for barbarism spoke more : None
1.1 :Than for that angel knowledge you can say, : None
1.1 :Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore : None
1.1 :And bide the penance of each three years' day. : None
1.1 :Give me the paper; let me read the same; : None
1.1 :And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :How well this yielding rescues thee from shame! : None
BIRON
1.1 :  'Item, That no woman shall come within a : Reads : ['Read - []'] : BIRON
1.1 :mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed? : None
LONGAVILLE
1.1 :Four days ago. : None
BIRON
1.1 :Let's see the penalty. : None
Reads : ['Read - []'] : BIRON
1.1 :'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty? : None
LONGAVILLE
1.1 :Marry, that did I. : None
BIRON
1.1 :Sweet lord, and why? : None
LONGAVILLE
1.1 :To fright them hence with that dread penalty. : None
BIRON
1.1 :A dangerous law against gentility! : None
Reads : ['Read - []'] : BIRON
1.1 :'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman : None
1.1 :within the term of three years, he shall endure such : None
1.1 :public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.' : None
1.1 :This article, my liege, yourself must break; : None
1.1 :For well you know here comes in embassy : None
1.1 :The French king's daughter with yourself to speak-- : None
1.1 :A maid of grace and complete majesty-- : None
1.1 :About surrender up of Aquitaine : None
1.1 :To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father: : None
1.1 :Therefore this article is made in vain, : None
1.1 :Or vainly comes the admired princess hither. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot. : None
BIRON
1.1 :So study evermore is overshot: : None
1.1 :While it doth study to have what it would : None
1.1 :It doth forget to do the thing it should, : None
1.1 :And when it hath the thing it hunteth most, : None
1.1 :'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :We must of force dispense with this decree; : None
1.1 :She must lie here on mere necessity. : None
BIRON
1.1 :Necessity will make us all forsworn : None
1.1 :Three thousand times within this three years' space; : None
1.1 :For every man with his affects is born, : None
1.1 :Not by might master'd but by special grace: : None
1.1 :If I break faith, this word shall speak for me; : None
1.1 :I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.' : None
1.1 :So to the laws at large I write my name: : None
Subscribes : ['None - []'] : BIRON
1.1 :And he that breaks them in the least degree : None
1.1 :Stands in attainder of eternal shame: : None
1.1 :Suggestions are to other as to me; : None
1.1 :But I believe, although I seem so loath, : None
1.1 :I am the last that will last keep his oath. : None
1.1 :But is there no quick recreation granted? : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted : None
1.1 :With a refined traveller of Spain; : None
1.1 :A man in all the world's new fashion planted, : None
1.1 :That hath a mint of phrases in his brain; : None
1.1 :One whom the music of his own vain tongue : None
1.1 :Doth ravish like enchanting harmony; : None
1.1 :A man of complements, whom right and wrong : None
1.1 :Have chose as umpire of their mutiny: : None
1.1 :This child of fancy, that Armado hight, : None
1.1 :For interim to our studies shall relate : None
1.1 :In high-born words the worth of many a knight : None
1.1 :From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate. : None
1.1 :How you delight, my lords, I know not, I; : None
1.1 :But, I protest, I love to hear him lie : None
1.1 :And I will use him for my minstrelsy. : None
BIRON
1.1 :Armado is a most illustrious wight, : None
1.1 :A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight. : None
LONGAVILLE
1.1 :Costard the swain and he shall be our sport; : None
1.1 :And so to study, three years is but short. : None
Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD : ["Enter - ['DULL', 'COSTARD']"] : LONGAVILLE
DULL
1.1 :Which is the duke's own person? : None
BIRON
1.1 :This, fellow: what wouldst? : None
DULL
1.1 :I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his : None
1.1 :grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person : None
1.1 :in flesh and blood. : None
BIRON
1.1 :This is he. : None
DULL
1.1 :Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany : None
1.1 :abroad: this letter will tell you more. : None
COSTARD
1.1 :Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :A letter from the magnificent Armado. : None
BIRON
1.1 :How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words. : None
LONGAVILLE
1.1 :A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience! : None
BIRON
1.1 :To hear? or forbear laughing? : None
LONGAVILLE
1.1 :To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to : None
1.1 :forbear both. : None
BIRON
1.1 :Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to : None
1.1 :climb in the merriness. : None
COSTARD
1.1 :The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta. : None
1.1 :The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner. : None
BIRON
1.1 :In what manner? : None
COSTARD
1.1 :In manner and form following, sir; all those three: : None
1.1 :I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with : None
1.1 :her upon the form, and taken following her into the : None
1.1 :park; which, put together, is in manner and form : None
1.1 :following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the : None
1.1 :manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,-- : None
1.1 :in some form. : None
BIRON
1.1 :For the following, sir? : None
COSTARD
1.1 :As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend : None
1.1 :the right! : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :Will you hear this letter with attention? : None
BIRON
1.1 :As we would hear an oracle. : None
COSTARD
1.1 :Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :  'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and : Reads : ['Read - []'] : FERDINAND
1.1 :sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god, : None
1.1 :and body's fostering patron.' : None
COSTARD
1.1 :Not a word of Costard yet. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :  'So it is,'-- : Reads : ['Read - []'] : FERDINAND
COSTARD
1.1 :It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in : None
1.1 :telling true, but so. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :Peace! : None
COSTARD
1.1 :Be to me and every man that dares not fight! : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :No words! : None
COSTARD
1.1 :Of other men's secrets, I beseech you. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :  'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured : Reads : ['Read - []'] : FERDINAND
1.1 :melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour : None
1.1 :to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving : None
1.1 :air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to : None
1.1 :walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when : None
1.1 :beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down : None
1.1 :to that nourishment which is called supper: so much : None
1.1 :for the time when. Now for the ground which; which, : None
1.1 :I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then : None
1.1 :for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter : None
1.1 :that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth : None
1.1 :from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which : None
1.1 :here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest; : None
1.1 :but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east : None
1.1 :and by east from the west corner of thy curious- : None
1.1 :knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited : None
1.1 :swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,'-- : None
COSTARD
1.1 :Me? : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :  'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'-- : Reads : ['Read - []'] : FERDINAND
COSTARD
1.1 :Me? : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :  'that shallow vassal,'-- : Reads : ['Read - []'] : FERDINAND
COSTARD
1.1 :Still me? : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :  'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'-- : Reads : ['Read - []'] : FERDINAND
COSTARD
1.1 :O, me! : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :  'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy : Reads : ['Read - []'] : FERDINAND
1.1 :established proclaimed edict and continent canon, : None
1.1 :which with,--O, with--but with this I passion to say : None

FERDINAND
1.1 :  'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a : Reads : ['Read - []'] : FERDINAND

1.1 :have sent to thee, to receive the meed of : None

1.1 :and heart-burning heat of duty. : None
1.1 :DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.' : None
BIRON
1.1 :This is not so well as I looked for, but the best : None
1.1 :that ever I heard. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say : None
1.1 :you to this? : None
COSTARD
1.1 :Sir, I confess the wench. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :Did you hear the proclamation? : None
COSTARD
1.1 :I do confess much of the hearing it but little of : None
1.1 :the marking of it. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken : None
1.1 :with a wench. : None
COSTARD
1.1 :I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.' : None
COSTARD
1.1 :This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.' : None
COSTARD
1.1 :If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :This maid will not serve your turn, sir. : None
COSTARD
1.1 :This maid will serve my turn, sir. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast : None
1.1 :a week with bran and water. : None
COSTARD
1.1 :I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge. : None
FERDINAND
1.1 :And Don Armado shall be your keeper. : None
1.1 :My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er: : None
1.1 :And go we, lords, to put in practise that : None
1.1 :Which each to other hath so strongly sworn. : None

BIRON
1.1 :I'll lay my head to any good man's hat, : None
1.1 :These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn. : None
1.1 :Sirrah, come on. : None
COSTARD
1.1 :I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was : None
1.1 :taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true : None
1.1 :girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of : None
1.1 :prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and : None
1.1 :till then, sit thee down, sorrow! : None

MOTH
1.2 :Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt? : None

1.2 :In thy condign praise. : None
MOTH
1.2 :I will praise an eel with the same praise. : None
1.2 :DON : None
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :What, that an eel is ingenious? : None
MOTH
1.2 :That an eel is quick. : None

ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :I confess both: they are both the varnish of a : None

ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is : None

1.2 :thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and : None
1.2 :ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised : None

1.2 :like a porter: and he was in love. : None
1.2 :DON : None
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do : None
1.2 :excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in : None
1.2 :carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's : None
1.2 :love, my dear Moth? : None
MOTH
1.2 :A woman, master. : None
1.2 :DON : None
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :Of what complexion? : None
MOTH

ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :Tell me precisely of what complexion. : None
MOTH
1.2 :Of the sea-water green, sir. : None
1.2 :DON : None
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :Is that one of the four complexions? : None
MOTH
1.2 :As I have read, sir; and the best of them too. : None
1.2 :DON : None
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a : None
1.2 :love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason : None
1.2 :for it. He surely affected her for her wit. : None
MOTH
1.2 :It was so, sir; for she had a green wit. : None
1.2 :DON : None
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :My love is most immaculate white and red. : None

1.2 :pathetical! : None
MOTH
1.2 :     If she be made of white and red, : None
1.2 :Her faults will ne'er be known, : None
1.2 :For blushing cheeks by faults are bred : None
1.2 :And fears by pale white shown: : None
1.2 :Then if she fear, or be to blame, : None
1.2 :By this you shall not know, : None
1.2 :For still her cheeks possess the same : None
1.2 :Which native she doth owe. : None
1.2 :A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of : None
1.2 :white and red. : None
1.2 :DON : None
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar? : None
MOTH
1.2 :The world was very guilty of such a ballad some : None
1.2 :three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be : None
1.2 :found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for : None
1.2 :the writing nor the tune. : None
1.2 :DON : None
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may : None
1.2 :example my digression by some mighty precedent. : None
1.2 :Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the : None
1.2 :park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well. : None
MOTH

1.2 :my master. : None
1.2 :DON : None
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love. : None
MOTH
1.2 :And that's great marvel, loving a light wench. : None
1.2 :DON : None
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :I say, sing. : None
MOTH
1.2 :Forbear till this company be past. : None

DULL
1.2 :Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard : None
1.2 :safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight : None
1.2 :nor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week. : None
1.2 :For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she : None
1.2 :is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well. : None
1.2 :DON : None
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :I do betray myself with blushing. Maid! : None
JAQUENETTA
1.2 :Man? : None
1.2 :DON : None
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :I will visit thee at the lodge. : None

ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou : None
1.2 :be pardoned. : None
COSTARD
1.2 :Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a : None
1.2 :full stomach. : None
1.2 :DON : None
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :Thou shalt be heavily punished. : None
COSTARD
1.2 :I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they : None
1.2 :are but lightly rewarded. : None
1.2 :DON : None
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :Take away this villain; shut him up. : None
MOTH
1.2 :Come, you transgressing slave; away! : None
COSTARD
1.2 :Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose. : None
MOTH
1.2 :No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison. : None
COSTARD
1.2 :Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation : None
1.2 :that I have seen, some shall see. : None
MOTH
1.2 :What shall some see? : None
COSTARD
1.2 :Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon. : None
1.2 :It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their : None
1.2 :words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank : None
1.2 :God I have as little patience as another man; and : None
1.2 :therefore I can be quiet. : None
Exeunt MOTH and COSTARD : ["Exeunt - ['MOTH', 'COSTARD']"] : COSTARD
1.2 :DON : None
ADRIANO DE ARMADO
1.2 :I do affect the very ground, which is base, where : None
1.2 :her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which : None
1.2 :is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which : None
1.2 :is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And : None
1.2 :how can that be true love which is falsely : None
1.2 :attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil: : None
1.2 :there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so : None
1.2 :tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was : None
1.2 :Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit. : None
1.2 :Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club; : None
1.2 :and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier. : None
1.2 :The first and second cause will not serve my turn; : None
1.2 :the passado he respects not, the duello he regards : None
1.2 :not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his : None
1.2 :glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier! : None
1.2 :be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea, : None
1.2 :he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme, : None
1.2 :for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit; : None
1.2 :write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio. : None

2.1 :Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues: : None
2.1 :I am less proud to hear you tell my worth : None
2.1 :Than you much willing to be counted wise : None
2.1 :In spending your wit in the praise of mine. : None
2.1 :But now to task the tasker: good Boyet, : None
2.1 :You are not ignorant, all-telling fame : None
2.1 :Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow, : None
2.1 :Till painful study shall outwear three years, : None
2.1 :No woman may approach his silent court: : None
2.1 :Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course, : None
2.1 :Before we enter his forbidden gates, : None
2.1 :To know his pleasure; and in that behalf, : None
2.1 :Bold of your worthiness, we single you : None
2.1 :As our best-moving fair solicitor. : None
2.1 :Tell him, the daughter of the King of France, : None
2.1 :On serious business, craving quick dispatch, : None

2.1 :Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir : None
2.1 :Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized : None
2.1 :In Normandy, saw I this Longaville: : None
2.1 :A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd; : None
2.1 :Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms: : None
2.1 :Nothing becomes him ill that he would well. : None
2.1 :The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss, : None
2.1 :If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil, : None
2.1 :Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will; : None
2.1 :Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills : None
2.1 :It should none spare that come within his power. : None
PRINCESS
2.1 :Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so? : None
MARIA

2.1 :Who are the rest? : None
KATHARINE

2.1 :Of all that virtue love for virtue loved: : None
2.1 :Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill; : None
2.1 :For he hath wit to make an ill shape good, : None
2.1 :And shape to win grace though he had no wit. : None
2.1 :I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once; : None
2.1 :And much too little of that good I saw : None

ROSALINE
2.1 :Another of these students at that time : None

2.1 :His eye begets occasion for his wit; : None
2.1 :For every object that the one doth catch : None
2.1 :The other turns to a mirth-moving jest, : None
2.1 :Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor, : None
2.1 :Delivers in such apt and gracious words : None
2.1 :That aged ears play truant at his tales : None
2.1 :And younger hearings are quite ravished; : None
2.1 :So sweet and voluble is his discourse. : None
PRINCESS
2.1 :God bless my ladies! are they all in love, : None

FERDINAND
2.1 :Your ladyship is ignorant what it is. : None

2.1 :I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping: : None
2.1 :Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord, : None
2.1 :And sin to break it. : None
2.1 :But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold: : None
2.1 :To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me. : None
2.1 :Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming, : None
2.1 :And suddenly resolve me in my suit. : None
FERDINAND

2.1 :But that one half which is unsatisfied, : None
2.1 :We will give up our right in Aquitaine, : None
2.1 :And hold fair friendship with his majesty. : None

2.1 :To have his title live in Aquitaine; : None
2.1 :Which we much rather had depart withal : None

FERDINAND
4.3 :O paradox! Black is the badge of hell, : None
4.3 :The hue of dungeons and the suit of night; : None
4.3 :And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well. : None
BIRON
4.3 :   Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light. : None
4.3 :O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd, : None
4.3 :It mourns that painting and usurping hair : None
4.3 :Should ravish doters with a false aspect; : None
4.3 :And therefore is she born to make black fair. : None
4.3 :Her favour turns the fashion of the days, : None
4.3 :For native blood is counted painting now; : None

4.3 :Have at you, then, affection's men at arms. : None
4.3 :Consider what you first did swear unto, : None
4.3 :To fast, to study, and to see no woman; : None
4.3 :Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth. : None
4.3 :Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young; : None
4.3 :And abstinence engenders maladies. : None
4.3 :And where that you have vow'd to study, lords, : None
4.3 :In that each of you have forsworn his book, : None
4.3 :Can you still dream and pore and thereon look? : None
4.3 :For when would you, my lord, or you, or you, : None
4.3 :Have found the ground of study's excellence : None
4.3 :Without the beauty of a woman's face? : None
From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;  They are the ground, the books, the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire : ['None - []'] : BIRON
4.3 :Why, universal plodding poisons up : None
4.3 :The nimble spirits in the arteries, : None
4.3 :As motion and long-during action tires : None
4.3 :The sinewy vigour of the traveller. : None
4.3 :Now, for not looking on a woman's face, : None
4.3 :You have in that forsworn the use of eyes : None
4.3 :And study too, the causer of your vow; : None
4.3 :For where is any author in the world : None
4.3 :Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye? : None
4.3 :Learning is but an adjunct to ourself : None
4.3 :And where we are our learning likewise is: : None
4.3 :Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes, : None
4.3 :Do we not likewise see our learning there? : None
4.3 :O, we have made a vow to study, lords, : None
4.3 :And in that vow we have forsworn our books. : None
4.3 :For when would you, my liege, or you, or you, : None
4.3 :In leaden contemplation have found out : None
4.3 :Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes : None
4.3 :Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with? : None
4.3 :Other slow arts entirely keep the brain; : None
4.3 :And therefore, finding barren practisers, : None
4.3 :Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil: : None
4.3 :But love, first learned in a lady's eyes, : None
4.3 :Lives not alone immured in the brain; : None
4.3 :But, with the motion of all elements, : None
4.3 :Courses as swift as thought in every power, : None
4.3 :And gives to every power a double power, : None
4.3 :Above their functions and their offices. : None
4.3 :It adds a precious seeing to the eye; : None
4.3 :A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind; : None
4.3 :A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound, : None
4.3 :When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd: : None
4.3 :Love's feeling is more soft and sensible : None
4.3 :Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails; : None
4.3 :Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste: : None
4.3 :For valour, is not Love a Hercules, : None
4.3 :Still climbing trees in the Hesperides? : None
4.3 :Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical : None
4.3 :As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair: : None
4.3 :And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods : None
4.3 :Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony. : None
4.3 :Never durst poet touch a pen to write : None
4.3 :Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs; : None
4.3 :O, then his lines would ravish savage ears : None
4.3 :And plant in tyrants mild humility. : None
4.3 :From women's eyes this doctrine I derive: : None
4.3 :They sparkle still the right Promethean fire; : None
4.3 :They are the books, the arts, the academes, : None
4.3 :That show, contain and nourish all the world: : None
4.3 :Else none at all in ought proves excellent. : None
4.3 :Then fools you were these women to forswear, : None
4.3 :Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools. : None
4.3 :For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love, : None
4.3 :Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men, : None
4.3 :Or for men's sake, the authors of these women, : None
4.3 :Or women's sake, by whom we men are men, : None
4.3 :Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves, : None
4.3 :Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths. : None
4.3 :It is religion to be thus forsworn, : None
4.3 :For charity itself fulfills the law, : None
4.3 :And who can sever love from charity? : None
FERDINAND
4.3 :Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field! : None
BIRON
4.3 :Advance your standards, and upon them, lords; : None
4.3 :Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised, : None
4.3 :In conflict that you get the sun of them. : None
LONGAVILLE
4.3 :Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by: : None
4.3 :Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France? : None
FERDINAND
4.3 :And win them too: therefore let us devise : None
4.3 :Some entertainment for them in their tents. : None
BIRON
4.3 :First, from the park let us conduct them thither; : None
4.3 :Then homeward every man attach the hand : None
4.3 :Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon : None
4.3 :We will with some strange pastime solace them, : None
4.3 :Such as the shortness of the time can shape; : None
4.3 :For revels, dances, masks and merry hours : None
4.3 :Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers. : None
FERDINAND
4.3 :Away, away! no time shall be omitted : None
4.3 :That will betime, and may by us be fitted. : None
BIRON
4.3 :Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn; : None
4.3 :And justice always whirls in equal measure: : None
4.3 :Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn; : None

Draws out his table-book : ['None - []'] : SIR NATHANIEL
