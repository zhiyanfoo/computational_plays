CANTERBURY
1.1 :My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged, : None
1.1 :Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign : None
1.1 :Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd, : None
1.1 :But that the scambling and unquiet time : None
1.1 :Did push it out of farther question. : None
ELY
1.1 :But how, my lord, shall we resist it now? : None
CANTERBURY
1.1 :It must be thought on. If it pass against us, : None
1.1 :We lose the better half of our possession: : None
1.1 :For all the temporal lands which men devout : None
1.1 :By testament have given to the church : None
1.1 :Would they strip from us; being valued thus: : None
1.1 :As much as would maintain, to the king's honour, : None
1.1 :Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights, : None
1.1 :Six thousand and two hundred good esquires; : None
1.1 :And, to relief of lazars and weak age, : None
1.1 :Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil. : None
1.1 :A hundred almshouses right well supplied; : None
1.1 :And to the coffers of the king beside, : None
1.1 :A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill. : None
ELY
1.1 :This would drink deep. : None
CANTERBURY
1.1 :'Twould drink the cup and all. : None
ELY
1.1 :But what prevention? : None
CANTERBURY
1.1 :The king is full of grace and fair regard. : None
ELY
1.1 :And a true lover of the holy church. : None
CANTERBURY
1.1 :The courses of his youth promised it not. : None
1.1 :The breath no sooner left his father's body, : None
1.1 :But that his wildness, mortified in him, : None
1.1 :Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment : None
1.1 :Consideration, like an angel, came : None
1.1 :And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him, : None
1.1 :Leaving his body as a paradise, : None
1.1 :To envelop and contain celestial spirits. : None
1.1 :Never was such a sudden scholar made; : None
1.1 :Never came reformation in a flood, : None
1.1 :With such a heady currance, scouring faults : None
1.1 :Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness : None
1.1 :So soon did lose his seat and all at once : None
1.1 :As in this king. : None
ELY
1.1 :                  We are blessed in the change. : None
CANTERBURY
1.1 :Hear him but reason in divinity, : None
1.1 :And all-admiring with an inward wish : None
1.1 :You would desire the king were made a prelate: : None
1.1 :Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs, : None
1.1 :You would say it hath been all in all his study: : None
1.1 :List his discourse of war, and you shall hear : None
1.1 :A fearful battle render'd you in music: : None
1.1 :Turn him to any cause of policy, : None
1.1 :The Gordian knot of it he will unloose, : None
1.1 :Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks, : None
1.1 :The air, a charter'd libertine, is still, : None
1.1 :And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears, : None
1.1 :To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences; : None
1.1 :So that the art and practic part of life : None
1.1 :Must be the mistress to this theoric: : None
1.1 :Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it, : None
1.1 :Since his addiction was to courses vain, : None
1.1 :His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow, : None
1.1 :His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports, : None
1.1 :And never noted in him any study, : None
1.1 :Any retirement, any sequestration : None
1.1 :From open haunts and popularity. : None
ELY
1.1 :The strawberry grows underneath the nettle : None
1.1 :And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best : None
1.1 :Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality: : None
1.1 :And so the prince obscured his contemplation : None
1.1 :Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt, : None
1.1 :Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night, : None
1.1 :Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty. : None
CANTERBURY
1.1 :It must be so; for miracles are ceased; : None
1.1 :And therefore we must needs admit the means : None
1.1 :How things are perfected. : None
ELY
1.1 :But, my good lord, : None
1.1 :How now for mitigation of this bill : None
1.1 :Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty : None
1.1 :Incline to it, or no? : None
CANTERBURY
1.1 :He seems indifferent, : None
1.1 :Or rather swaying more upon our part : None
1.1 :Than cherishing the exhibiters against us; : None
1.1 :For I have made an offer to his majesty, : None
1.1 :Upon our spiritual convocation : None
1.1 :And in regard of causes now in hand, : None
1.1 :Which I have open'd to his grace at large, : None
1.1 :As touching France, to give a greater sum : None
1.1 :Than ever at one time the clergy yet : None
1.1 :Did to his predecessors part withal. : None
ELY
1.1 :How did this offer seem received, my lord? : None
CANTERBURY
1.1 :With good acceptance of his majesty; : None
1.1 :Save that there was not time enough to hear, : None
1.1 :As I perceived his grace would fain have done, : None
1.1 :The severals and unhidden passages : None
1.1 :Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms : None
1.1 :And generally to the crown and seat of France : None
1.1 :Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather. : None
ELY
1.1 :What was the impediment that broke this off? : None
CANTERBURY
1.1 :The French ambassador upon that instant : None
1.1 :Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come : None
1.1 :To give him hearing: is it four o'clock? : None
ELY
1.1 :It is. : None
CANTERBURY
1.1 :Then go we in, to know his embassy; : None
1.1 :Which I could with a ready guess declare, : None
1.1 :Before the Frenchman speak a word of it. : None
ELY
1.1 :I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it. : None

KING HENRY V
1.2 :Send for him, good uncle. : None
WESTMORELAND
1.2 :Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege? : None
KING HENRY V
1.2 :Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved, : None
1.2 :Before we hear him, of some things of weight : None
1.2 :That task our thoughts, concerning us and France. : None

CANTERBURY
1.2 :God and his angels guard your sacred throne : None
1.2 :And make you long become it! : None
KING HENRY V
1.2 :Sure, we thank you. : None
1.2 :My learned lord, we pray you to proceed : None
1.2 :And justly and religiously unfold : None
1.2 :Why the law Salique that they have in France : None
1.2 :Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim: : None
1.2 :And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord, : None
1.2 :That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading, : None
1.2 :Or nicely charge your understanding soul : None
1.2 :With opening titles miscreate, whose right : None
1.2 :Suits not in native colours with the truth; : None
1.2 :For God doth know how many now in health : None
1.2 :Shall drop their blood in approbation : None
1.2 :Of what your reverence shall incite us to. : None
1.2 :Therefore take heed how you impawn our person, : None
1.2 :How you awake our sleeping sword of war: : None
1.2 :We charge you, in the name of God, take heed; : None
1.2 :For never two such kingdoms did contend : None
1.2 :Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops : None
1.2 :Are every one a woe, a sore complaint : None
1.2 :'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords : None
1.2 :That make such waste in brief mortality. : None
1.2 :Under this conjuration, speak, my lord; : None
1.2 :For we will hear, note and believe in heart : None
1.2 :That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd : None
1.2 :As pure as sin with baptism. : None
CANTERBURY
1.2 :Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers, : None
1.2 :That owe yourselves, your lives and services : None
1.2 :To this imperial throne. There is no bar : None
1.2 :To make against your highness' claim to France : None
1.2 :But this, which they produce from Pharamond, : None
1.2 :'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:' : None
1.2 :'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:' : None
1.2 :Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze : None
1.2 :To be the realm of France, and Pharamond : None
1.2 :The founder of this law and female bar. : None
1.2 :Yet their own authors faithfully affirm : None
1.2 :That the land Salique is in Germany, : None
1.2 :Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe; : None
1.2 :Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons, : None
1.2 :There left behind and settled certain French; : None
1.2 :Who, holding in disdain the German women : None
1.2 :For some dishonest manners of their life, : None
1.2 :Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female : None
1.2 :Should be inheritrix in Salique land: : None
1.2 :Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala, : None
1.2 :Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen. : None
1.2 :Then doth it well appear that Salique law : None
1.2 :Was not devised for the realm of France: : None
1.2 :Nor did the French possess the Salique land : None
1.2 :Until four hundred one and twenty years : None
1.2 :After defunction of King Pharamond, : None
1.2 :Idly supposed the founder of this law; : None
1.2 :Who died within the year of our redemption : None
1.2 :Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great : None
1.2 :Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French : None
1.2 :Beyond the river Sala, in the year : None
1.2 :Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say, : None
1.2 :King Pepin, which deposed Childeric, : None
1.2 :Did, as heir general, being descended : None
1.2 :Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair, : None
1.2 :Make claim and title to the crown of France. : None
1.2 :Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown : None
1.2 :Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male : None
1.2 :Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great, : None
1.2 :To find his title with some shows of truth, : None
1.2 :'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught, : None
1.2 :Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare, : None
1.2 :Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son : None
1.2 :To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son : None
1.2 :Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth, : None
1.2 :Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet, : None
1.2 :Could not keep quiet in his conscience, : None
1.2 :Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied : None
1.2 :That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother, : None
1.2 :Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare, : None
1.2 :Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine: : None
1.2 :By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great : None
1.2 :Was re-united to the crown of France. : None
1.2 :So that, as clear as is the summer's sun. : None
1.2 :King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim, : None
1.2 :King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear : None
1.2 :To hold in right and title of the female: : None
1.2 :So do the kings of France unto this day; : None
1.2 :Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law : None
1.2 :To bar your highness claiming from the female, : None
1.2 :And rather choose to hide them in a net : None
1.2 :Than amply to imbar their crooked titles : None
1.2 :Usurp'd from you and your progenitors. : None
KING HENRY V
1.2 :May I with right and conscience make this claim? : None
CANTERBURY
1.2 :The sin upon my head, dread sovereign! : None
1.2 :For in the book of Numbers is it writ, : None
1.2 :When the man dies, let the inheritance : None
1.2 :Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord, : None
1.2 :Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag; : None
1.2 :Look back into your mighty ancestors: : None
1.2 :Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb, : None
1.2 :From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit, : None
1.2 :And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince, : None
1.2 :Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy, : None
1.2 :Making defeat on the full power of France, : None
1.2 :Whiles his most mighty father on a hill : None
1.2 :Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp : None
1.2 :Forage in blood of French nobility. : None
1.2 :O noble English. that could entertain : None
1.2 :With half their forces the full Pride of France : None
1.2 :And let another half stand laughing by, : None
1.2 :All out of work and cold for action! : None
ELY
1.2 :Awake remembrance of these valiant dead : None
1.2 :And with your puissant arm renew their feats: : None
1.2 :You are their heir; you sit upon their throne; : None
1.2 :The blood and courage that renowned them : None
1.2 :Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege : None
1.2 :Is in the very May-morn of his youth, : None
1.2 :Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises. : None
EXETER
1.2 :Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth : None
1.2 :Do all expect that you should rouse yourself, : None
1.2 :As did the former lions of your blood. : None
WESTMORELAND
1.2 :They know your grace hath cause and means and might; : None
1.2 :So hath your highness; never king of England : None
1.2 :Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects, : None
1.2 :Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England : None
1.2 :And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France. : None
CANTERBURY
1.2 :O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege, : None
1.2 :With blood and sword and fire to win your right; : None
1.2 :In aid whereof we of the spiritualty : None
1.2 :Will raise your highness such a mighty sum : None
1.2 :As never did the clergy at one time : None
1.2 :Bring in to any of your ancestors. : None
KING HENRY V
1.2 :We must not only arm to invade the French, : None
1.2 :But lay down our proportions to defend : None
1.2 :Against the Scot, who will make road upon us : None
1.2 :With all advantages. : None
CANTERBURY
1.2 :They of those marches, gracious sovereign, : None
1.2 :Shall be a wall sufficient to defend : None
1.2 :Our inland from the pilfering borderers. : None
KING HENRY V
1.2 :We do not mean the coursing snatchers only, : None
1.2 :But fear the main intendment of the Scot, : None
1.2 :Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us; : None
1.2 :For you shall read that my great-grandfather : None
1.2 :Never went with his forces into France : None
1.2 :But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom : None
1.2 :Came pouring, like the tide into a breach, : None
1.2 :With ample and brim fulness of his force, : None
1.2 :Galling the gleaned land with hot assays, : None
1.2 :Girding with grievous siege castles and towns; : None
1.2 :That England, being empty of defence, : None
1.2 :Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood. : None
CANTERBURY
1.2 :She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege; : None
1.2 :For hear her but exampled by herself: : None
1.2 :When all her chivalry hath been in France : None
1.2 :And she a mourning widow of her nobles, : None
1.2 :She hath herself not only well defended : None
1.2 :But taken and impounded as a stray : None
1.2 :The King of Scots; whom she did send to France, : None
1.2 :To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings : None
1.2 :And make her chronicle as rich with praise : None
1.2 :As is the ooze and bottom of the sea : None
1.2 :With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries. : None
WESTMORELAND
1.2 :But there's a saying very old and true, : None
1.2 :'If that you will France win, : None
1.2 :Then with Scotland first begin:' : None
1.2 :For once the eagle England being in prey, : None
1.2 :To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot : None
1.2 :Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs, : None
1.2 :Playing the mouse in absence of the cat, : None
1.2 :To tear and havoc more than she can eat. : None
EXETER
1.2 :It follows then the cat must stay at home: : None
1.2 :Yet that is but a crush'd necessity, : None
1.2 :Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries, : None
1.2 :And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves. : None
1.2 :While that the armed hand doth fight abroad, : None
1.2 :The advised head defends itself at home; : None
1.2 :For government, though high and low and lower, : None
1.2 :Put into parts, doth keep in one consent, : None
1.2 :Congreeing in a full and natural close, : None
1.2 :Like music. : None
CANTERBURY
1.2 :          Therefore doth heaven divide : None
1.2 :The state of man in divers functions, : None
1.2 :Setting endeavour in continual motion; : None
1.2 :To which is fixed, as an aim or butt, : None
1.2 :Obedience: for so work the honey-bees, : None
1.2 :Creatures that by a rule in nature teach : None
1.2 :The act of order to a peopled kingdom. : None
1.2 :They have a king and officers of sorts; : None
1.2 :Where some, like magistrates, correct at home, : None
1.2 :Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad, : None
1.2 :Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings, : None
1.2 :Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds, : None
1.2 :Which pillage they with merry march bring home : None
1.2 :To the tent-royal of their emperor; : None
1.2 :Who, busied in his majesty, surveys : None
1.2 :The singing masons building roofs of gold, : None
1.2 :The civil citizens kneading up the honey, : None
1.2 :The poor mechanic porters crowding in : None
1.2 :Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate, : None
1.2 :The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum, : None
1.2 :Delivering o'er to executors pale : None
1.2 :The lazy yawning drone. I this infer, : None
1.2 :That many things, having full reference : None
1.2 :To one consent, may work contrariously: : None
1.2 :As many arrows, loosed several ways, : None
1.2 :Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town; : None
1.2 :As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea; : None
1.2 :As many lines close in the dial's centre; : None
1.2 :So may a thousand actions, once afoot. : None
1.2 :End in one purpose, and be all well borne : None
1.2 :Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege. : None
1.2 :Divide your happy England into four; : None
1.2 :Whereof take you one quarter into France, : None
1.2 :And you withal shall make all Gallia shake. : None
1.2 :If we, with thrice such powers left at home, : None
1.2 :Cannot defend our own doors from the dog, : None
1.2 :Let us be worried and our nation lose : None
1.2 :The name of hardiness and policy. : None

Exeunt some Attendants : ['Exeunt - []'] : KING HENRY V
1.2 :Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help, : None
1.2 :And yours, the noble sinews of our power, : None
1.2 :France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe, : None
1.2 :Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit, : None
1.2 :Ruling in large and ample empery : None
1.2 :O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms, : None
1.2 :Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn, : None
1.2 :Tombless, with no remembrance over them: : None
1.2 :Either our history shall with full mouth : None
1.2 :Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave, : None
1.2 :Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth, : None
1.2 :Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph. : None
Enter Ambassadors of France : ['Enter - []'] : KING HENRY V
1.2 :Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure : None
1.2 :Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear : None
1.2 :Your greeting is from him, not from the king. : None
FIRST AMBASSADOR
1.2 :May't please your majesty to give us leave : None
1.2 :Freely to render what we have in charge; : None
1.2 :Or shall we sparingly show you far off : None
1.2 :The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy? : None
KING HENRY V
1.2 :We are no tyrant, but a Christian king; : None
1.2 :Unto whose grace our passion is as subject : None
1.2 :As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons: : None
1.2 :Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness : None
1.2 :Tell us the Dauphin's mind. : None
FIRST AMBASSADOR
1.2 :Thus, then, in few. : None
1.2 :Your highness, lately sending into France, : None
1.2 :Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right : None
1.2 :Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third. : None
1.2 :In answer of which claim, the prince our master : None
1.2 :Says that you savour too much of your youth, : None
1.2 :And bids you be advised there's nought in France : None
1.2 :That can be with a nimble galliard won; : None
1.2 :You cannot revel into dukedoms there. : None
1.2 :He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit, : None
1.2 :This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this, : None
1.2 :Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim : None
1.2 :Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks. : None
KING HENRY V
1.2 :What treasure, uncle? : None
EXETER
1.2 :Tennis-balls, my liege. : None
KING HENRY V
1.2 :We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us; : None
1.2 :His present and your pains we thank you for: : None
1.2 :When we have march'd our rackets to these balls, : None
1.2 :We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set : None
1.2 :Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard. : None
1.2 :Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler : None
1.2 :That all the courts of France will be disturb'd : None
1.2 :With chaces. And we understand him well, : None
1.2 :How he comes o'er us with our wilder days, : None
1.2 :Not measuring what use we made of them. : None
1.2 :We never valued this poor seat of England; : None
1.2 :And therefore, living hence, did give ourself : None
1.2 :To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common : None
1.2 :That men are merriest when they are from home. : None
1.2 :But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state, : None
1.2 :Be like a king and show my sail of greatness : None
1.2 :When I do rouse me in my throne of France: : None
1.2 :For that I have laid by my majesty : None
1.2 :And plodded like a man for working-days, : None
1.2 :But I will rise there with so full a glory : None
1.2 :That I will dazzle all the eyes of France, : None
1.2 :Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us. : None
1.2 :And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his : None
1.2 :Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul : None
1.2 :Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance : None
1.2 :That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows : None
1.2 :Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands; : None
1.2 :Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down; : None
1.2 :And some are yet ungotten and unborn : None
1.2 :That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn. : None
1.2 :But this lies all within the will of God, : None
1.2 :To whom I do appeal; and in whose name : None
1.2 :Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on, : None
1.2 :To venge me as I may and to put forth : None
1.2 :My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause. : None
1.2 :So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin : None
1.2 :His jest will savour but of shallow wit, : None
1.2 :When thousands weep more than did laugh at it. : None
1.2 :Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well. : None
Exeunt Ambassadors : ['Exeunt - []'] : KING HENRY V
EXETER
1.2 :This was a merry message. : None
KING HENRY V
1.2 :We hope to make the sender blush at it. : None
1.2 :Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour : None
1.2 :That may give furtherance to our expedition; : None
1.2 :For we have now no thought in us but France, : None
1.2 :Save those to God, that run before our business. : None
1.2 :Therefore let our proportions for these wars : None
1.2 :Be soon collected and all things thought upon : None
1.2 :That may with reasonable swiftness add : None
1.2 :More feathers to our wings; for, God before, : None
1.2 :We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door. : None

DAUPHIN
3.7 :Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the : None

4.1 :Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be : None
4.1 :washed off the next tide. : None
BATES
4.1 :He hath not told his thought to the king? : None
KING HENRY V
4.1 :No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I : None
4.1 :speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I : None
4.1 :am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the : None
4.1 :element shows to him as it doth to me; all his : None
4.1 :senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies : None
4.1 :laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and : None
4.1 :though his affections are higher mounted than ours, : None
4.1 :yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like : None
4.1 :wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we : None
4.1 :do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish : None
4.1 :as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess : None
4.1 :him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing : None
4.1 :it, should dishearten his army. : None
BATES
4.1 :He may show what outward courage he will; but I : None
4.1 :believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish : None
4.1 :himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he : None
4.1 :were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here. : None
KING HENRY V
4.1 :By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king: : None
4.1 :I think he would not wish himself any where but : None
4.1 :where he is. : None
BATES
4.1 :Then I would he were here alone; so should he be : None
4.1 :sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved. : None
KING HENRY V
4.1 :I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here : None
4.1 :alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's : None
4.1 :minds: methinks I could not die any where so : None
4.1 :contented as in the king's company; his cause being : None
4.1 :just and his quarrel honourable. : None
WILLIAMS
4.1 :That's more than we know. : None
BATES
4.1 :Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know : None
4.1 :enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if : None
4.1 :his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes : None
4.1 :the crime of it out of us. : None
WILLIAMS
4.1 :But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath : None
4.1 :a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and : None
4.1 :arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join : None
4.1 :together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at : None
4.1 :such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a : None
4.1 :surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind : None
4.1 :them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their : None
4.1 :children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die : None
4.1 :well that die in a battle; for how can they : None
4.1 :charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their : None
4.1 :argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it : None
4.1 :will be a black matter for the king that led them to : None
4.1 :it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of : None
4.1 :subjection. : None
KING HENRY V
4.1 :So, if a son that is by his father sent about : None
4.1 :merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the : None
4.1 :imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be : None
4.1 :imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a : None
4.1 :servant, under his master's command transporting a : None
4.1 :sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in : None
4.1 :many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the : None
4.1 :business of the master the author of the servant's : None
4.1 :damnation: but this is not so: the king is not : None
4.1 :bound to answer the particular endings of his : None
4.1 :soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of : None
4.1 :his servant; for they purpose not their death, when : None
4.1 :they purpose their services. Besides, there is no : None
4.1 :king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to : None
4.1 :the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all : None
4.1 :unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them : None
4.1 :the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder; : None
4.1 :some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of : None
4.1 :perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that : None
4.1 :have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with : None
4.1 :pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have : None
4.1 :defeated the law and outrun native punishment, : None
4.1 :though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to : None
4.1 :fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance; : None
4.1 :so that here men are punished for before-breach of : None
4.1 :the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where : None
4.1 :they feared the death, they have borne life away; : None
4.1 :and where they would be safe, they perish: then if : None
4.1 :they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of : None
4.1 :their damnation than he was before guilty of those : None
4.1 :impieties for the which they are now visited. Every : None
4.1 :subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's : None
4.1 :soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in : None
4.1 :the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every : None
4.1 :mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death : None
4.1 :is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was : None
4.1 :blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained: : None
4.1 :and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think : None
4.1 :that, making God so free an offer, He let him : None
4.1 :outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach : None
4.1 :others how they should prepare. : None

KING HENRY V
5.2 :O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with : None

5.2 :I said so, dear Katharine; and I must not blush to : None

KATHARINE
5.2 :O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de : None

ALICE
5.2 :Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of : None
5.2 :deceits: dat is de princess. : None
KING HENRY V
5.2 :The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith, : None
5.2 :Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am : None
5.2 :glad thou canst speak no better English; for, if : None
5.2 :thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king : None
5.2 :that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my : None
5.2 :crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but : None
5.2 :directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me : None
5.2 :farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out : None
5.2 :my suit. Give me your answer; i' faith, do: and so : None
5.2 :clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady? : None
KATHARINE
5.2 :Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell. : None
KING HENRY V
5.2 :Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for : None
5.2 :your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I : None
5.2 :have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I : None
5.2 :have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable : None
5.2 :measure in strength. If I could win a lady at : None
5.2 :leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my : None
5.2 :armour on my back, under the correction of bragging : None
5.2 :be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife. : None
5.2 :Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse : None
5.2 :for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and : None
5.2 :sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God, : None
5.2 :Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my : None
5.2 :eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation; : None
5.2 :only downright oaths, which I never use till urged, : None
5.2 :nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a : None
5.2 :fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth : None
5.2 :sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love : None
5.2 :of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy : None
5.2 :cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst : None
5.2 :love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee : None
5.2 :that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the : None
5.2 :Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou : None
5.2 :livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and : None
5.2 :uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee : None
5.2 :right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other : None
5.2 :places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that : None
5.2 :can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do : None
5.2 :always reason themselves out again. What! a : None
5.2 :speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A : None
5.2 :good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a : None
5.2 :black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow : None
5.2 :bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax : None
5.2 :hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the : None
5.2 :moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it : None
5.2 :shines bright and never changes, but keeps his : None
5.2 :course truly. If thou would have such a one, take : None
5.2 :me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier, : None
5.2 :take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love? : None
5.2 :speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee. : None
KATHARINE
5.2 :Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France? : None
KING HENRY V
5.2 :No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of : None
5.2 :France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love : None
5.2 :the friend of France; for I love France so well that : None
5.2 :I will not part with a village of it; I will have it : None
5.2 :all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am : None
5.2 :yours, then yours is France and you are mine. : None
KATHARINE
5.2 :I cannot tell vat is dat. : None
KING HENRY V
5.2 :No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am : None
5.2 :sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married : None
5.2 :wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook : None
5.2 :off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand : None
5.2 :vous avez le possession de moi,--let me see, what : None
5.2 :then? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre est : None
5.2 :France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me, : None
5.2 :Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much : None
5.2 :more French: I shall never move thee in French, : None
5.2 :unless it be to laugh at me. : None
KATHARINE
5.2 :Sauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez, il : None
5.2 :est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle. : None
KING HENRY V
5.2 :No, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of my : None
5.2 :tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs : None
5.2 :be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou : None
5.2 :understand thus much English, canst thou love me? : None
KATHARINE
5.2 :I cannot tell. : None
KING HENRY V
5.2 :Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll ask : None
5.2 :them. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night, : None
5.2 :when you come into your closet, you'll question this : None
5.2 :gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to : None
5.2 :her dispraise those parts in me that you love with : None
5.2 :your heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the : None
5.2 :rather, gentle princess, because I love thee : None
5.2 :cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a : None
5.2 :saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get : None
5.2 :thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs : None
5.2 :prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I, : None
5.2 :between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a : None
5.2 :boy, half French, half English, that shall go to : None
5.2 :Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard? : None
5.2 :shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair : None
5.2 :flower-de-luce? : None
KATHARINE
5.2 :I do not know dat : None
KING HENRY V
5.2 :No; 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: do : None
5.2 :but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your : None
5.2 :French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety : None
5.2 :take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer : None
5.2 :you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cher : None
5.2 :et devin deesse? : None
KATHARINE
5.2 :Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de : None
5.2 :most sage demoiselle dat is en France. : None
KING HENRY V
5.2 :Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in : None
5.2 :true English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I : None
5.2 :dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to : None
5.2 :flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor : None
5.2 :and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew : None
5.2 :my father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars : None
5.2 :when he got me: therefore was I created with a : None
5.2 :stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when : None
