1.1 :Could ever hear by tale or history, : None
1.1 :The course of true love never did run smooth; : None
1.1 :But, either it was different in blood,-- : None
HERMIA
1.1 :O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low. : None
LYSANDER
1.1 :Or else misgraffed in respect of years,-- : None
HERMIA
1.1 :O spite! too old to be engaged to young. : None
LYSANDER
1.1 :Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,-- : None
HERMIA
1.1 :O hell! to choose love by another's eyes. : None
LYSANDER
1.1 :Or, if there were a sympathy in choice, : None
1.1 :War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it, : None

HERMIA
1.1 :If then true lovers have been ever cross'd, : None
1.1 :It stands as an edict in destiny: : None

1.1 :Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air : None
1.1 :More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear, : None
1.1 :When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear. : None
1.1 :Sickness is catching: O, were favour so, : None
1.1 :Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go; : None
1.1 :My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye, : None
1.1 :My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody. : None
1.1 :Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated, : None

HELENA

HERMIA
1.1 :Take comfort: he no more shall see my face; : None
1.1 :Lysander and myself will fly this place. : None

LYSANDER
1.1 :Helen, to you our minds we will unfold: : None
1.1 :To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold : None
1.1 :Her silver visage in the watery glass, : None
1.1 :Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass, : None
1.1 :A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal, : None
1.1 :Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal. : None
HERMIA
1.1 :And in the wood, where often you and I : None
1.1 :Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie, : None
1.1 :Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet, : None
1.1 :There my Lysander and myself shall meet; : None
1.1 :And thence from Athens turn away our eyes, : None
1.1 :To seek new friends and stranger companies. : None

1.1 :But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so; : None
1.1 :He will not know what all but he do know: : None
1.1 :And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes, : None
1.1 :So I, admiring of his qualities: : None
1.1 :Things base and vile, folding no quantity, : None
1.1 :Love can transpose to form and dignity: : None
1.1 :Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind; : None
1.1 :And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind: : None
1.1 :Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste; : None
1.1 :Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste: : None
1.1 :And therefore is Love said to be a child, : None
1.1 :Because in choice he is so oft beguiled. : None
1.1 :As waggish boys in game themselves forswear, : None
1.1 :So the boy Love is perjured every where: : None
1.1 :For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne, : None
1.1 :He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine; : None
1.1 :And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt, : None
1.1 :So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt. : None
1.1 :I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight: : None
1.1 :Then to the wood will he to-morrow night : None
1.1 :Pursue her; and for this intelligence : None
1.1 :If I have thanks, it is a dear expense: : None

1.2 :You were best to call them generally, man by man, : None

QUINCE
1.2 :Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is : None

QUINCE
1.2 :You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus. : None
BOTTOM
1.2 :What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant? : None
QUINCE
1.2 :A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love. : None
BOTTOM
1.2 :That will ask some tears in the true performing of : None
1.2 :it: if I do it, let the audience look to their : None
1.2 :eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some : None
1.2 :measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a : None
1.2 :tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to : None
1.2 :tear a cat in, to make all split. : None
1.2 :The raging rocks : None
1.2 :And shivering shocks : None
1.2 :Shall break the locks : None
1.2 :Of prison gates; : None
1.2 :And Phibbus' car : None

1.2 :And make and mar : None
1.2 :The foolish Fates. : None
1.2 :This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players. : None

QUINCE
1.2 :Francis Flute, the bellows-mender. : None
FLUTE
1.2 :Here, Peter Quince. : None
QUINCE
1.2 :Flute, you must take Thisby on you. : None
FLUTE
1.2 :What is Thisby? a wandering knight? : None
QUINCE
1.2 :It is the lady that Pyramus must love. : None
FLUTE
1.2 :Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming. : None
QUINCE
1.2 :That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and : None
1.2 :you may speak as small as you will. : None
BOTTOM
1.2 :An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll : None
1.2 :speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne, : None
1.2 :Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear, : None
1.2 :and lady dear!' : None
QUINCE
1.2 :No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby. : None

SNUG
1.2 :Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it : None
1.2 :be, give it me, for I am slow of study. : None
QUINCE
1.2 :You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring. : None
BOTTOM
1.2 :Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will : None
1.2 :do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar, : None
1.2 :that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again, : None
1.2 :let him roar again.' : None
QUINCE
1.2 :An you should do it too terribly, you would fright : None
1.2 :the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek; : None
1.2 :and that were enough to hang us all. : None
ALL
1.2 :That would hang us, every mother's son. : None
BOTTOM
1.2 :I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the : None
1.2 :ladies out of their wits, they would have no more : None

1.2 :sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any : None

QUINCE
1.2 :You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a : None

QUINCE
1.2 :Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and : None

1.2 :you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night; : None
1.2 :and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the : None
1.2 :town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if : None

1.2 :company, and our devices known. In the meantime I : None
1.2 :will draw a bill of properties, such as our play : None
1.2 :wants. I pray you, fail me not. : None
BOTTOM
1.2 :We will meet; and there we may rehearse most : None
1.2 :obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu. : None
QUINCE
1.2 :At the duke's oak we meet. : None

BOTTOM
3.1 :Are we all met? : None
QUINCE
3.1 :Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place : None
3.1 :for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our : None
3.1 :stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we : None
3.1 :will do it in action as we will do it before the duke. : None
BOTTOM
3.1 :Peter Quince,-- : None
QUINCE
3.1 :What sayest thou, bully Bottom? : None
BOTTOM
3.1 :There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and : None
3.1 :Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must : None
3.1 :draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies : None
3.1 :cannot abide. How answer you that? : None
SNOUT
3.1 :By'r lakin, a parlous fear. : None
STARVELING
3.1 :I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done. : None
BOTTOM
3.1 :Not a whit: I have a device to make all well. : None
3.1 :Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to : None
3.1 :say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that : None
3.1 :Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more : None
3.1 :better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not : None
3.1 :Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them : None
3.1 :out of fear. : None
QUINCE
3.1 :Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be : None
3.1 :written in eight and six. : None
BOTTOM
3.1 :No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight. : None
SNOUT
3.1 :Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion? : None
STARVELING
3.1 :I fear it, I promise you. : None
BOTTOM
3.1 :Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to : None
3.1 :bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a : None
3.1 :most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful : None
3.1 :wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to : None
3.1 :look to 't. : None
SNOUT
3.1 :Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion. : None
BOTTOM
3.1 :Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must : None
3.1 :be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself : None
3.1 :must speak through, saying thus, or to the same : None
3.1 :defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish : None
3.1 :You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would : None
3.1 :entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life : None
3.1 :for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it : None
3.1 :were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a : None
3.1 :man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name : None
3.1 :his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner. : None
QUINCE
3.1 :Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things; : None
3.1 :that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for, : None
3.1 :you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight. : None
SNOUT
3.1 :Doth the moon shine that night we play our play? : None
BOTTOM
3.1 :A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find : None
3.1 :out moonshine, find out moonshine. : None
QUINCE
3.1 :Yes, it doth shine that night. : None
BOTTOM
3.1 :Why, then may you leave a casement of the great : None
3.1 :chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon : None
3.1 :may shine in at the casement. : None
QUINCE
3.1 :Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns : None
3.1 :and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to : None
3.1 :present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is : None
3.1 :another thing: we must have a wall in the great : None
3.1 :chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did : None
3.1 :talk through the chink of a wall. : None
SNOUT
3.1 :You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom? : None
BOTTOM
3.1 :Some man or other must present Wall: and let him : None
3.1 :have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast : None
3.1 :about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his : None
3.1 :fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus : None
3.1 :and Thisby whisper. : None
QUINCE
3.1 :If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit  down, : None

5.1 :Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me! : None
THESEUS
5.1 :The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again. : None
PYRAMUS
5.1 :No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me' : None
5.1 :is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to : None

HIPPOLYTA
5.1 :It must be your imagination then, and not theirs. : None
THESEUS
5.1 :If we imagine no worse of them than they of : None

LYSANDER
5.1 :This lion is a very fox for his valour. : None
THESEUS
5.1 :True; and a goose for his discretion. : None
DEMETRIUS
5.1 :Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his : None
5.1 :discretion; and the fox carries the goose. : None
THESEUS
5.1 :His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour; : None
5.1 :for the goose carries not the fox. It is well: : None
5.1 :leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon. : None
MOONSHINE
5.1 :This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;-- : None
DEMETRIUS

MOONSHINE
5.1 :This lanthorn doth the horned moon present; : None
5.1 :Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be. : None
THESEUS
5.1 :This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man : None

DEMETRIUS
5.1 :He dares not come there for the candle; for, you : None
5.1 :see, it is already in snuff. : None
HIPPOLYTA
5.1 :I am aweary of this moon: would he would change! : None
THESEUS
5.1 :It appears, by his small light of discretion, that : None
5.1 :he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all : None
5.1 :reason, we must stay the time. : None
LYSANDER
5.1 :Proceed, Moon. : None
MOONSHINE
5.1 :All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the : None

5.1 :thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog. : None
DEMETRIUS
5.1 :Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all : None

THESEUS
5.1 :This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would : None

HIPPOLYTA
5.1 :Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man. : None
PYRAMUS
5.1 :O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame? : None
5.1 :Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear: : None

DEMETRIUS
5.1 :No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one. : None
LYSANDER
5.1 :Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing. : None
THESEUS
5.1 :With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and : None

HIPPOLYTA
5.1 :How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes : None

THESEUS
5.1 :No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no : None

5.1 :that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself : None
5.1 :in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine : None
5.1 :tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably : None
