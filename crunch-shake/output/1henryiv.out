Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others : ["Enter - ['LANCASTER', 'WESTMORELAND', 'SIR WALTER BLUNT']"] : None
KING HENRY IV
1.1 :So shaken as we are, so wan with care, : None
1.1 :Find we a time for frighted peace to pant, : None
1.1 :And breathe short-winded accents of new broils : None
1.1 :To be commenced in strands afar remote. : None
1.1 :No more the thirsty entrance of this soil : None
1.1 :Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood; : None
1.1 :Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields, : None
1.1 :Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs : None
1.1 :Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes, : None
1.1 :Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven, : None
1.1 :All of one nature, of one substance bred, : None
1.1 :Did lately meet in the intestine shock : None
1.1 :And furious close of civil butchery : None
1.1 :Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks, : None
1.1 :March all one way and be no more opposed : None
1.1 :Against acquaintance, kindred and allies: : None
1.1 :The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife, : None
1.1 :No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends, : None
1.1 :As far as to the sepulchre of Christ, : None
1.1 :Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross : None
1.1 :We are impressed and engaged to fight, : None
1.1 :Forthwith a power of English shall we levy; : None
1.1 :Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb : None
1.1 :To chase these pagans in those holy fields : None
1.1 :Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet : None
1.1 :Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd : None
1.1 :For our advantage on the bitter cross. : None
1.1 :But this our purpose now is twelve month old, : None
1.1 :And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go: : None
1.1 :Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear : None
1.1 :Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland, : None
1.1 :What yesternight our council did decree : None
1.1 :In forwarding this dear expedience. : None
WESTMORELAND
1.1 :My liege, this haste was hot in question, : None
1.1 :And many limits of the charge set down : None
1.1 :But yesternight: when all athwart there came : None
1.1 :A post from Wales loaden with heavy news; : None
1.1 :Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer, : None
1.1 :Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight : None
1.1 :Against the irregular and wild Glendower, : None
1.1 :Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken, : None
1.1 :A thousand of his people butchered; : None
1.1 :Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse, : None
1.1 :Such beastly shameless transformation, : None
1.1 :By those Welshwomen done as may not be : None
1.1 :Without much shame retold or spoken of. : None
KING HENRY IV
1.1 :It seems then that the tidings of this broil : None
1.1 :Brake off our business for the Holy Land. : None
WESTMORELAND
1.1 :This match'd with other did, my gracious lord; : None
1.1 :For more uneven and unwelcome news : None
1.1 :Came from the north and thus it did import: : None
1.1 :On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there, : None
1.1 :Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald, : None
1.1 :That ever-valiant and approved Scot, : None
1.1 :At Holmedon met, : None
1.1 :Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour, : None
1.1 :As by discharge of their artillery, : None
1.1 :And shape of likelihood, the news was told; : None
1.1 :For he that brought them, in the very heat : None
1.1 :And pride of their contention did take horse, : None
1.1 :Uncertain of the issue any way. : None
KING HENRY IV
1.1 :Here is a dear, a true industrious friend, : None
1.1 :Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse. : None
1.1 :Stain'd with the variation of each soil : None
1.1 :Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours; : None
1.1 :And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news. : None
1.1 :The Earl of Douglas is discomfited: : None
1.1 :Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights, : None
1.1 :Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see : None
1.1 :On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took : None
1.1 :Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son : None
1.1 :To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol, : None
1.1 :Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith: : None
1.1 :And is not this an honourable spoil? : None
1.1 :A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not? : None
WESTMORELAND
1.1 :In faith, : None
1.1 :It is a conquest for a prince to boast of. : None
KING HENRY IV
1.1 :Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin : None
1.1 :In envy that my Lord Northumberland : None
1.1 :Should be the father to so blest a son, : None
1.1 :A son who is the theme of honour's tongue; : None
1.1 :Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant; : None
1.1 :Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride: : None
1.1 :Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him, : None
1.1 :See riot and dishonour stain the brow : None
1.1 :Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved : None
1.1 :That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged : None
1.1 :In cradle-clothes our children where they lay, : None
1.1 :And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet! : None
1.1 :Then would I have his Harry, and he mine. : None
1.1 :But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz, : None
1.1 :Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners, : None
1.1 :Which he in this adventure hath surprised, : None
1.1 :To his own use he keeps; and sends me word, : None
1.1 :I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife. : None
WESTMORELAND
1.1 :This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester, : None
1.1 :Malevolent to you in all aspects; : None
1.1 :Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up : None
1.1 :The crest of youth against your dignity. : None
KING HENRY IV
1.1 :But I have sent for him to answer this; : None
1.1 :And for this cause awhile we must neglect : None
1.1 :Our holy purpose to Jerusalem. : None
1.1 :Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we : None
1.1 :Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords: : None
1.1 :But come yourself with speed to us again; : None
1.1 :For more is to be said and to be done : None
1.1 :Than out of anger can be uttered. : None
WESTMORELAND
1.1 :I will, my liege. : None

Scene(scene=2)
Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF : ["Enter - ['FALSTAFF']"] : WESTMORELAND
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad? : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack : None
1.2 :and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon : None
1.2 :benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to : None
1.2 :demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know. : None
1.2 :What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the : None
1.2 :day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes : None
1.2 :capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the : None
1.2 :signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself : None
1.2 :a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no : None
1.2 :reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand : None
1.2 :the time of the day. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take : None
1.2 :purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not : None
1.2 :by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And, : None
1.2 :I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God : None
1.2 :save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace : None
1.2 :thou wilt have none,-- : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :What, none? : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to : None
1.2 :prologue to an egg and butter. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not : None
1.2 :us that are squires of the night's body be called : None
1.2 :thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's : None
1.2 :foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the : None
1.2 :moon; and let men say we be men of good government, : None
1.2 :being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and : None
1.2 :chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the : None
1.2 :fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and : None
1.2 :flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is, : None
1.2 :by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold : None
1.2 :most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most : None
1.2 :dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with : None
1.2 :swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;' : None
1.2 :now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder : None
1.2 :and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my : None
1.2 :hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench? : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And : None
1.2 :is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance? : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and : None
1.2 :thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a : None
1.2 :buff jerkin? : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern? : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a : None
1.2 :time and oft. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part? : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch; : None
1.2 :and where it would not, I have used my credit. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent : None
1.2 :that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet : None
1.2 :wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when : None
1.2 :thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is : None
1.2 :with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do : None
1.2 :not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :No; thou shalt. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have : None
1.2 :the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my : None
1.2 :humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell : None
1.2 :you. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :For obtaining of suits? : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman : None
1.2 :hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy : None
1.2 :as a gib cat or a lugged bear. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Or an old lion, or a lover's lute. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of : None
1.2 :Moor-ditch? : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed : None
1.2 :the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young : None
1.2 :prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more : None
1.2 :with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a : None
1.2 :commodity of good names were to be bought. An old : None
1.2 :lord of the council rated me the other day in the : None
1.2 :street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet : None
1.2 :he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and : None
1.2 :yet he talked wisely, and in the street too. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the : None
1.2 :streets, and no man regards it. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able : None
1.2 :to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon : None
1.2 :me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew : None
1.2 :thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man : None
1.2 :should speak truly, little better than one of the : None
1.2 :wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give : None
1.2 :it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain: : None
1.2 :I'll be damned for never a king's son in : None
1.2 :Christendom. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack? : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I : None
1.2 :do not, call me villain and baffle me. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying : None
1.2 :to purse-taking. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a : None
1.2 :man to labour in his vocation. : None
Enter POINS : ["Enter - ['POINS']"] : FALSTAFF
1.2 :Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a : None
1.2 :match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what : None
1.2 :hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the : None
1.2 :most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to : None
1.2 :a true man. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Good morrow, Ned. : None
POINS
1.2 :Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse? : None
1.2 :what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how : None
1.2 :agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou : None
1.2 :soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira : None
1.2 :and a cold capon's leg? : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have : None
1.2 :his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of : None
1.2 :proverbs: he will give the devil his due. : None
POINS
1.2 :Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Else he had been damned for cozening the devil. : None
POINS
1.2 :But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four : None
1.2 :o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going : None
1.2 :to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders : None
1.2 :riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards : None
1.2 :for you all; you have horses for yourselves: : None
1.2 :Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke : None
1.2 :supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it : None
1.2 :as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff : None
1.2 :your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry : None
1.2 :at home and be hanged. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not, : None
1.2 :I'll hang you for going. : None
POINS
1.2 :You will, chops? : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Hal, wilt thou make one? : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good : None
1.2 :fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood : None
1.2 :royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Why, that's well said. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :I care not. : None
POINS
1.2 :Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone: : None
1.2 :I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure : None
1.2 :that he shall go. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him : None
1.2 :the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may : None
1.2 :move and what he hears may be believed, that the : None
1.2 :true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false : None
1.2 :thief; for the poor abuses of the time want : None
1.2 :countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer! : None
Exit Falstaff : ["Exit - ['FALSTAFF']"] : PRINCE HENRY
POINS
1.2 :Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us : None
1.2 :to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot : None
1.2 :manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill : None
1.2 :shall rob those men that we have already waylaid: : None
1.2 :yourself and I will not be there; and when they : None
1.2 :have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut : None
1.2 :this head off from my shoulders. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :How shall we part with them in setting forth? : None
POINS
1.2 :Why, we will set forth before or after them, and : None
1.2 :appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at : None
1.2 :our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure : None
1.2 :upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have : None
1.2 :no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our : None
1.2 :horses, by our habits and by every other : None
1.2 :appointment, to be ourselves. : None
POINS
1.2 :Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them : None
1.2 :in the wood; our vizards we will change after we : None
1.2 :leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram : None
1.2 :for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us. : None
POINS
1.2 :Well, for two of them, I know them to be as : None
1.2 :true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the : None
1.2 :third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll : None
1.2 :forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the : None
1.2 :incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will : None
1.2 :tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at : None
1.2 :least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what : None
1.2 :extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this : None
1.2 :lies the jest. : None
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things : None
1.2 :necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap; : None
1.2 :there I'll sup. Farewell. : None
POINS
1.2 :Farewell, my lord. : None
Exit Poins : ["Exit - ['POINS']"] : POINS
PRINCE HENRY
1.2 :I know you all, and will awhile uphold : None
1.2 :The unyoked humour of your idleness: : None
1.2 :Yet herein will I imitate the sun, : None
1.2 :Who doth permit the base contagious clouds : None
1.2 :To smother up his beauty from the world, : None
1.2 :That, when he please again to be himself, : None
1.2 :Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at, : None
1.2 :By breaking through the foul and ugly mists : None
1.2 :Of vapours that did seem to strangle him. : None
1.2 :If all the year were playing holidays, : None
1.2 :To sport would be as tedious as to work; : None
1.2 :But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come, : None
1.2 :And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents. : None
1.2 :So, when this loose behavior I throw off : None
1.2 :And pay the debt I never promised, : None
1.2 :By how much better than my word I am, : None
1.2 :By so much shall I falsify men's hopes; : None
1.2 :And like bright metal on a sullen ground, : None
1.2 :My reformation, glittering o'er my fault, : None
1.2 :Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes : None
1.2 :Than that which hath no foil to set it off. : None
1.2 :I'll so offend, to make offence a skill; : None
1.2 :Redeeming time when men think least I will. : None

KING HENRY IV
1.3 :My blood hath been too cold and temperate, : None
1.3 :Unapt to stir at these indignities, : None
1.3 :And you have found me; for accordingly : None
1.3 :You tread upon my patience: but be sure : None
1.3 :I will from henceforth rather be myself, : None
1.3 :Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition; : None
1.3 :Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down, : None
1.3 :And therefore lost that title of respect : None
1.3 :Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud. : None
EARL OF WORCESTER
1.3 :Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves : None
1.3 :The scourge of greatness to be used on it; : None

NORTHUMBERLAND

KING HENRY IV
1.3 :Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see : None
1.3 :Danger and disobedience in thine eye: : None
1.3 :O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory, : None
1.3 :And majesty might never yet endure : None
1.3 :The moody frontier of a servant brow. : None
1.3 :You have good leave to leave us: when we need : None

NORTHUMBERLAND
1.3 :Yea, my good lord. : None
1.3 :Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded, : None
1.3 :Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took, : None
1.3 :Were, as he says, not with such strength denied : None
1.3 :As is deliver'd to your majesty: : None
1.3 :Either envy, therefore, or misprison : None
1.3 :Is guilty of this fault and not my son. : None
HOTSPUR
1.3 :My liege, I did deny no prisoners. : None
1.3 :But I remember, when the fight was done, : None
1.3 :When I was dry with rage and extreme toil, : None
1.3 :Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword, : None
1.3 :Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd, : None
1.3 :Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd : None
1.3 :Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home; : None
1.3 :He was perfumed like a milliner; : None
1.3 :And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held : None
1.3 :A pouncet-box, which ever and anon : None
1.3 :He gave his nose and took't away again; : None
1.3 :Who therewith angry, when it next came there, : None
1.3 :Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd, : None
1.3 :And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by, : None
1.3 :He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly, : None
1.3 :To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse : None
1.3 :Betwixt the wind and his nobility. : None
1.3 :With many holiday and lady terms : None
1.3 :He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded : None
1.3 :My prisoners in your majesty's behalf. : None
1.3 :I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold, : None
1.3 :To be so pester'd with a popinjay, : None
1.3 :Out of my grief and my impatience, : None
1.3 :Answer'd neglectingly I know not what, : None
1.3 :He should or he should not; for he made me mad : None
1.3 :To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet : None
1.3 :And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman : None
1.3 :Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!-- : None
1.3 :And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth : None
1.3 :Was parmaceti for an inward bruise; : None
1.3 :And that it was great pity, so it was, : None
1.3 :This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd : None
1.3 :Out of the bowels of the harmless earth, : None
1.3 :Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd : None
1.3 :So cowardly; and but for these vile guns, : None
1.3 :He would himself have been a soldier. : None
1.3 :This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord, : None
1.3 :I answer'd indirectly, as I said; : None

HOTSPUR
1.3 :Revolted Mortimer! : None
1.3 :He never did fall off, my sovereign liege, : None

1.3 :Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took : None
1.3 :When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank, : None

EARL OF WORCESTER
1.3 :Who struck this heat up after I was gone? : None
HOTSPUR

EARL OF WORCESTER
1.3 :Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you : None

HOTSPUR
1.3 :Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods, : None

NORTHUMBERLAND

HOTSPUR
1.3 :I smell it: upon my life, it will do well. : None
NORTHUMBERLAND
1.3 :Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip. : None
HOTSPUR
1.3 :Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot; : None
1.3 :And then the power of Scotland and of York, : None
1.3 :To join with Mortimer, ha? : None
EARL OF WORCESTER
1.3 :And so they shall. : None
HOTSPUR
1.3 :In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd. : None
EARL OF WORCESTER
1.3 :And 'tis no little reason bids us speed, : None
1.3 :To save our heads by raising of a head; : None
1.3 :For, bear ourselves as even as we can, : None
1.3 :The king will always think him in our debt, : None

2.1 :as truly as a man of falsehood may. : None
GADSHILL
2.1 :What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang, : None
2.1 :I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old : None

2.1 :starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou : None
2.1 :dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are : None
2.1 :content to do the profession some grace; that would, : None
2.1 :if matters should be looked into, for their own : None

2.1 :strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than : None
2.1 :drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds, : None
2.1 :I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the : None

CHAMBERLAIN
2.1 :What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold : None

CHAMBERLAIN
2.1 :Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to : None

2.4 :there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old : None
2.4 :Jack, then am I no two-legged creature. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :Pray God you have not murdered some of them. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two : None
2.4 :of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues : None
2.4 :in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell : None
2.4 :thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou : None
2.4 :knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my : None
2.4 :point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me-- : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :What, four? thou saidst but two even now. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :Four, Hal; I told thee four. : None
POINS
2.4 :Ay, ay, he said four. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at : None
2.4 :me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven : None
2.4 :points in my target, thus. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :Seven? why, there were but four even now. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :In buckram? : None
POINS
2.4 :Ay, four, in buckram suits. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :Dost thou hear me, Hal? : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :Ay, and mark thee too, Jack. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine : None
2.4 :in buckram that I told thee of-- : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :So, two more already. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :Their points being broken,-- : None
POINS
2.4 :Down fell their hose. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :Began to give me ground: but I followed me close, : None
2.4 :came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of : None
2.4 :the eleven I paid. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two! : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten : None
2.4 :knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive : None
2.4 :at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst : None
2.4 :not see thy hand. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :These lies are like their father that begets them; : None
2.4 :gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou : None
2.4 :clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou : None
2.4 :whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,-- : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth : None
2.4 :the truth? : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal : None
2.4 :green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy : None
2.4 :hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this? : None
POINS
2.4 :Come, your reason, Jack, your reason. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the : None
2.4 :strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would : None
2.4 :not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on : None
2.4 :compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as : None

2.4 :compulsion, I. : None

FALSTAFF
2.4 :'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried : None

POINS
2.4 :Mark, Jack. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and : None
2.4 :were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain : None
2.4 :tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you : None
2.4 :four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your : None
2.4 :prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in : None
2.4 :the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts : None
2.4 :away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared : None
2.4 :for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard : None
2.4 :bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword : None
2.4 :as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight! : None
2.4 :What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst : None
2.4 :thou now find out to hide thee from this open and : None
2.4 :apparent shame? : None
POINS
2.4 :Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now? : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye. : None
2.4 :Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the : None
2.4 :heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince? : None
2.4 :why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but : None
2.4 :beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true : None
2.4 :prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a : None
2.4 :coward on instinct. I shall think the better of : None
2.4 :myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant : None
2.4 :lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord, : None
2.4 :lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap : None

PETO
2.4 :Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would : None
2.4 :swear truth out of England but he would make you : None
2.4 :believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like. : None
BARDOLPH
2.4 :Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to : None
2.4 :make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments : None

PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years : None
2.4 :ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since : None

FALSTAFF
2.4 :My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was : None
2.4 :not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have : None
2.4 :crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of : None
2.4 :sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a : None
2.4 :bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was : None
2.4 :Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the : None

FALSTAFF
2.4 :O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :Yes, Jack, upon instinct. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too, : None
2.4 :and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more: : None
2.4 :Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's : None
2.4 :beard is turned white with the news: you may buy : None
2.4 :land now as cheap as stinking mackerel. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and : None
2.4 :this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads : None
2.4 :as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we : None

2.4 :art not thou horrible afeard? thou being : None
2.4 :heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three : None
2.4 :such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that : None

PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct. : None
FALSTAFF

PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the : None

FALSTAFF
2.4 :Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state, : None
2.4 :this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden : None

2.4 :crown for a pitiful bald crown! : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee, : None
2.4 :now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to : None
2.4 :make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have : None
2.4 :wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it : None
2.4 :in King Cambyses' vein. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :Well, here is my leg. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility. : None
HOSTESS
2.4 :O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith! : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain. : None
HOSTESS
2.4 :O, the father, how he holds his countenance! : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen; : None
2.4 :For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes. : None
HOSTESS
2.4 :O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry : None

FALSTAFF
2.4 :Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain. : None
2.4 :Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy : None
2.4 :time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though : None
2.4 :the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster : None
2.4 :it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the : None
2.4 :sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have : None
2.4 :partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion, : None
2.4 :but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a : None
2.4 :foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant : None
2.4 :me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point; : None
2.4 :why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall : None
2.4 :the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat : None
2.4 :blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall : None
2.4 :the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a : None
2.4 :question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry, : None
2.4 :which thou hast often heard of and it is known to : None
2.4 :many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch, : None
2.4 :as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth : None
2.4 :the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not : None
2.4 :speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in : None
2.4 :pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in : None
2.4 :woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I : None
2.4 :have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :What manner of man, an it like your majesty? : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a : None
2.4 :cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble : None
2.4 :carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or, : None
2.4 :by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I : None
2.4 :remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man : None
2.4 :should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry, : None
2.4 :I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be : None
2.4 :known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then, : None
2.4 :peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that : None
2.4 :Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell : None
2.4 :me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast : None
2.4 :thou been this month? : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me, : None
2.4 :and I'll play my father. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so : None
2.4 :majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by : None
2.4 :the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :Well, here I am set. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :And here I stand: judge, my masters. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :Now, Harry, whence come you? : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :My noble lord, from Eastcheap. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :The complaints I hear of thee are grievous. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle : None
2.4 :ye for a young prince, i' faith. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look : None
2.4 :on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace: : None
2.4 :there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an : None
2.4 :old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why : None
2.4 :dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that : None
2.4 :bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel : None
2.4 :of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed : None
2.4 :cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with : None
2.4 :the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that : None
2.4 :grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in : None
2.4 :years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and : None
2.4 :drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a : None
2.4 :capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft? : None
2.4 :wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous, : None
2.4 :but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing? : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :I would your grace would take me with you: whom : None
2.4 :means your grace? : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :That villanous abominable misleader of youth, : None
2.4 :Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :My lord, the man I know. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.4 :I know thou dost. : None
FALSTAFF
2.4 :But to say I know more harm in him than in myself, : None
2.4 :were to say more than I know. That he is old, the : None
2.4 :more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but : None
2.4 :that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster, : None
2.4 :that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault, : None
2.4 :God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a : None
2.4 :sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if : None
2.4 :to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine : None
2.4 :are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto, : None
2.4 :banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack : None
2.4 :Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff, : None
2.4 :valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant, : None
2.4 :being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him : None
2.4 :thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's : None

3.1 :Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur, : None
3.1 :For by that name as oft as Lancaster : None
3.1 :Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with : None
3.1 :A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven. : None
HOTSPUR
3.1 :And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of. : None
GLENDOWER
3.1 :I cannot blame him: at my nativity : None
3.1 :The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes, : None
3.1 :Of burning cressets; and at my birth : None
3.1 :The frame and huge foundation of the earth : None
3.1 :Shaked like a coward. : None
HOTSPUR
3.1 :Why, so it would have done at the same season, if : None
3.1 :your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself : None
3.1 :had never been born. : None
GLENDOWER
3.1 :I say the earth did shake when I was born. : None
HOTSPUR
3.1 :And I say the earth was not of my mind, : None
3.1 :If you suppose as fearing you it shook. : None
GLENDOWER
3.1 :The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble. : None
HOTSPUR
3.1 :O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire, : None
3.1 :And not in fear of your nativity. : None
3.1 :Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth : None
3.1 :In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth : None
3.1 :Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd : None
3.1 :By the imprisoning of unruly wind : None
3.1 :Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving, : None
3.1 :Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down : None
3.1 :Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth : None
3.1 :Our grandam earth, having this distemperature, : None
3.1 :In passion shook. : None
GLENDOWER
3.1 :                  Cousin, of many men : None
3.1 :I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave : None
3.1 :To tell you once again that at my birth : None
3.1 :The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes, : None
3.1 :The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds : None
3.1 :Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields. : None
3.1 :These signs have mark'd me extraordinary; : None
3.1 :And all the courses of my life do show : None
3.1 :I am not in the roll of common men. : None
3.1 :Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea : None
3.1 :That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales, : None
3.1 :Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me? : None
3.1 :And bring him out that is but woman's son : None
3.1 :Can trace me in the tedious ways of art : None
3.1 :And hold me pace in deep experiments. : None
HOTSPUR
3.1 :I think there's no man speaks better Welsh. : None
3.1 :I'll to dinner. : None
MORTIMER
3.1 :Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad. : None
GLENDOWER
3.1 :I can call spirits from the vasty deep. : None
HOTSPUR
3.1 :Why, so can I, or so can any man; : None
3.1 :But will they come when you do call for them? : None
GLENDOWER
3.1 :Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command : None
3.1 :The devil. : None
HOTSPUR
3.1 :And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil : None
3.1 :By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil. : None
3.1 :If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither, : None
3.1 :And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence. : None
3.1 :O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil! : None
MORTIMER
3.1 :Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat. : None
GLENDOWER
3.1 :Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head : None
3.1 :Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye : None
3.1 :And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him : None
3.1 :Bootless home and weather-beaten back. : None
HOTSPUR
3.1 :Home without boots, and in foul weather too! : None
3.1 :How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name? : None
GLENDOWER
3.1 :Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right : None
3.1 :According to our threefold order ta'en? : None
MORTIMER
3.1 :The archdeacon hath divided it : None
3.1 :Into three limits very equally: : None
3.1 :England, from Trent and Severn hitherto, : None
3.1 :By south and east is to my part assign'd: : None
3.1 :All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore, : None
3.1 :And all the fertile land within that bound, : None
3.1 :To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you : None
3.1 :The remnant northward, lying off from Trent. : None
3.1 :And our indentures tripartite are drawn; : None
3.1 :Which being sealed interchangeably, : None
3.1 :A business that this night may execute, : None
3.1 :To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I : None
3.1 :And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth : None
3.1 :To meet your father and the Scottish power, : None
3.1 :As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury. : None
3.1 :My father Glendower is not ready yet, : None
3.1 :Not shall we need his help these fourteen days. : None
3.1 :Within that space you may have drawn together : None
3.1 :Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen. : None
GLENDOWER
3.1 :A shorter time shall send me to you, lords: : None
3.1 :And in my conduct shall your ladies come; : None
3.1 :From whom you now must steal and take no leave, : None
3.1 :For there will be a world of water shed : None
3.1 :Upon the parting of your wives and you. : None
HOTSPUR
3.1 :Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here, : None
3.1 :In quantity equals not one of yours: : None
3.1 :See how this river comes me cranking in, : None
3.1 :And cuts me from the best of all my land : None
3.1 :A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out. : None
3.1 :I'll have the current in this place damm'd up; : None
3.1 :And here the smug and silver Trent shall run : None
3.1 :In a new channel, fair and evenly; : None
3.1 :It shall not wind with such a deep indent, : None
3.1 :To rob me of so rich a bottom here. : None
GLENDOWER
3.1 :Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth. : None
MORTIMER
3.1 :Yea, but : None
3.1 :Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up : None
3.1 :With like advantage on the other side; : None
3.1 :Gelding the opposed continent as much : None
3.1 :As on the other side it takes from you. : None
EARL OF WORCESTER
3.1 :Yea, but a little charge will trench him here : None
3.1 :And on this north side win this cape of land; : None
3.1 :And then he runs straight and even. : None
HOTSPUR
3.1 :I'll have it so: a little charge will do it. : None
GLENDOWER
3.1 :I'll not have it alter'd. : None
HOTSPUR
3.1 :Will not you? : None
GLENDOWER
3.1 :No, nor you shall not. : None
HOTSPUR
3.1 :Who shall say me nay? : None
GLENDOWER
3.1 :Why, that will I. : None
HOTSPUR
3.1 :Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh. : None
GLENDOWER
3.1 :I can speak English, lord, as well as you; : None
3.1 :For I was train'd up in the English court; : None
3.1 :Where, being but young, I framed to the harp : None
3.1 :Many an English ditty lovely well : None
3.1 :And gave the tongue a helpful ornament, : None
3.1 :A virtue that was never seen in you. : None
HOTSPUR
3.1 :Marry, : None
3.1 :And I am glad of it with all my heart: : None
3.1 :I had rather be a kitten and cry mew : None
3.1 :Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers; : None
3.1 :I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd, : None
3.1 :Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree; : None
3.1 :And that would set my teeth nothing on edge, : None
3.1 :Nothing so much as mincing poetry: : None
3.1 :'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag. : None
GLENDOWER
3.1 :Come, you shall have Trent turn'd. : None
HOTSPUR
3.1 :I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land : None
3.1 :To any well-deserving friend; : None
3.1 :But in the way of bargain, mark ye me, : None
3.1 :I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair. : None
3.1 :Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone? : None
GLENDOWER
3.1 :The moon shines fair; you may away by night: : None
3.1 :I'll haste the writer and withal : None
3.1 :Break with your wives of your departure hence: : None

MORTIMER
3.1 :Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father! : None
HOTSPUR
3.1 :I cannot choose: sometime he angers me : None
3.1 :With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant, : None
3.1 :Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies, : None
3.1 :And of a dragon and a finless fish, : None
3.1 :A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven, : None
3.1 :A couching lion and a ramping cat, : None
3.1 :And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff : None
3.1 :As puts me from my faith. I tell you what; : None
3.1 :He held me last night at least nine hours : None
3.1 :In reckoning up the several devils' names : None
3.1 :That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,' : None
3.1 :But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious : None
3.1 :As a tired horse, a railing wife; : None
3.1 :Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live : None
3.1 :With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far, : None
3.1 :Than feed on cates and have him talk to me : None
3.1 :In any summer-house in Christendom. : None
MORTIMER
3.1 :In faith, he is a worthy gentleman, : None
3.1 :Exceedingly well read, and profited : None
3.1 :In strange concealments, valiant as a lion : None
3.1 :And as wondrous affable and as bountiful : None
3.1 :As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin? : None
3.1 :He holds your temper in a high respect : None
3.1 :And curbs himself even of his natural scope : None
3.1 :When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does: : None
3.1 :I warrant you, that man is not alive : None
3.1 :Might so have tempted him as you have done, : None
3.1 :Without the taste of danger and reproof: : None
3.1 :But do not use it oft, let me entreat you. : None
EARL OF WORCESTER
3.1 :In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame; : None
3.1 :And since your coming hither have done enough : None
3.1 :To put him quite beside his patience. : None
3.1 :You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault: : None
3.1 :Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,-- : None
3.1 :And that's the dearest grace it renders you,-- : None
3.1 :Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage, : None
3.1 :Defect of manners, want of government, : None
3.1 :Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain: : None
3.1 :The least of which haunting a nobleman : None
3.1 :Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain : None

The lady speaks again in Welsh : ['None - []'] : MORTIMER
3.1 :I understand thy kisses and thou mine, : None
3.1 :And that's a feeling disputation: : None

3.1 :Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue : None
3.1 :Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd, : None

The lady speaks again in Welsh : ['None - []'] : GLENDOWER
MORTIMER
3.1 :O, I am ignorance itself in this! : None
GLENDOWER
3.1 :She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down : None
3.1 :And rest your gentle head upon her lap, : None
3.1 :And she will sing the song that pleaseth you : None
3.1 :And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep. : None
3.1 :Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness, : None
3.1 :Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep : None

MORTIMER
3.1 :With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing: : None
3.1 :By that time will our book, I think, be drawn : None

3.1 :By'r lady, he is a good musician. : None
LADY PERCY
3.1 :Then should you be nothing but musical for you are : None

3.1 :'as sure as day,' : None
3.1 :And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths, : None

KING HENRY IV
3.2 :Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I : None
3.2 :Must have some private conference; but be near at hand, : None
3.2 :For we shall presently have need of you. : None
Exeunt Lords : ['Exeunt - []'] : KING HENRY IV
3.2 :I know not whether God will have it so, : None
3.2 :For some displeasing service I have done, : None
3.2 :That, in his secret doom, out of my blood : None
3.2 :He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me; : None
3.2 :But thou dost in thy passages of life : None
3.2 :Make me believe that thou art only mark'd : None
3.2 :For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven : None
3.2 :To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else, : None
3.2 :Could such inordinate and low desires, : None
3.2 :Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts, : None
3.2 :Such barren pleasures, rude society, : None
3.2 :As thou art match'd withal and grafted to, : None
3.2 :Accompany the greatness of thy blood : None
3.2 :And hold their level with thy princely heart? : None
PRINCE HENRY
3.2 :So please your majesty, I would I could : None
3.2 :Quit all offences with as clear excuse : None
3.2 :As well as I am doubtless I can purge : None
3.2 :Myself of many I am charged withal: : None
3.2 :Yet such extenuation let me beg, : None
3.2 :As, in reproof of many tales devised, : None
3.2 :which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear, : None
3.2 :By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers, : None
3.2 :I may, for some things true, wherein my youth : None
3.2 :Hath faulty wander'd and irregular, : None
3.2 :Find pardon on my true submission. : None
KING HENRY IV
3.2 :God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry, : None
3.2 :At thy affections, which do hold a wing : None
3.2 :Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors. : None
3.2 :Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost. : None
3.2 :Which by thy younger brother is supplied, : None
3.2 :And art almost an alien to the hearts : None
3.2 :Of all the court and princes of my blood: : None
3.2 :The hope and expectation of thy time : None
3.2 :Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man : None
3.2 :Prophetically doth forethink thy fall. : None
3.2 :Had I so lavish of my presence been, : None
3.2 :So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men, : None
3.2 :So stale and cheap to vulgar company, : None
3.2 :Opinion, that did help me to the crown, : None
3.2 :Had still kept loyal to possession : None
3.2 :And left me in reputeless banishment, : None
3.2 :A fellow of no mark nor likelihood. : None
3.2 :By being seldom seen, I could not stir : None
3.2 :But like a comet I was wonder'd at; : None
3.2 :That men would tell their children 'This is he;' : None
3.2 :Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?' : None
3.2 :And then I stole all courtesy from heaven, : None
3.2 :And dress'd myself in such humility : None
3.2 :That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts, : None
3.2 :Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths, : None
3.2 :Even in the presence of the crowned king. : None
3.2 :Thus did I keep my person fresh and new; : None
3.2 :My presence, like a robe pontifical, : None
3.2 :Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state, : None
3.2 :Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast : None
3.2 :And won by rareness such solemnity. : None
3.2 :The skipping king, he ambled up and down : None
3.2 :With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits, : None
3.2 :Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state, : None
3.2 :Mingled his royalty with capering fools, : None
3.2 :Had his great name profaned with their scorns : None
3.2 :And gave his countenance, against his name, : None
3.2 :To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push : None
3.2 :Of every beardless vain comparative, : None
3.2 :Grew a companion to the common streets, : None
3.2 :Enfeoff'd himself to popularity; : None
3.2 :That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes, : None
3.2 :They surfeited with honey and began : None
3.2 :To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little : None
3.2 :More than a little is by much too much. : None
3.2 :So when he had occasion to be seen, : None
3.2 :He was but as the cuckoo is in June, : None
3.2 :Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes : None
3.2 :As, sick and blunted with community, : None
3.2 :Afford no extraordinary gaze, : None
3.2 :Such as is bent on sun-like majesty : None
3.2 :When it shines seldom in admiring eyes; : None
3.2 :But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down, : None
3.2 :Slept in his face and render'd such aspect : None
3.2 :As cloudy men use to their adversaries, : None
3.2 :Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full. : None
3.2 :And in that very line, Harry, standest thou; : None
3.2 :For thou has lost thy princely privilege : None
3.2 :With vile participation: not an eye : None
3.2 :But is a-weary of thy common sight, : None
3.2 :Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more; : None
3.2 :Which now doth that I would not have it do, : None
3.2 :Make blind itself with foolish tenderness. : None

3.2 :Be more myself. : None
KING HENRY IV
3.2 :                  For all the world : None
3.2 :As thou art to this hour was Richard then : None
3.2 :When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh, : None
3.2 :And even as I was then is Percy now. : None
3.2 :Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot, : None
3.2 :He hath more worthy interest to the state : None
3.2 :Than thou the shadow of succession; : None
3.2 :For of no right, nor colour like to right, : None
3.2 :He doth fill fields with harness in the realm, : None
3.2 :Turns head against the lion's armed jaws, : None
3.2 :And, being no more in debt to years than thou, : None
3.2 :Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on : None
3.2 :To bloody battles and to bruising arms. : None
3.2 :What never-dying honour hath he got : None
3.2 :Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds, : None
3.2 :Whose hot incursions and great name in arms : None
3.2 :Holds from all soldiers chief majority : None
3.2 :And military title capital : None
3.2 :Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ: : None
3.2 :Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes, : None
3.2 :This infant warrior, in his enterprises : None
3.2 :Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once, : None
3.2 :Enlarged him and made a friend of him, : None
3.2 :To fill the mouth of deep defiance up : None
3.2 :And shake the peace and safety of our throne. : None
3.2 :And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland, : None
3.2 :The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer, : None
3.2 :Capitulate against us and are up. : None
3.2 :But wherefore do I tell these news to thee? : None
3.2 :Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes, : None
3.2 :Which art my near'st and dearest enemy? : None
3.2 :Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear, : None
3.2 :Base inclination and the start of spleen : None
3.2 :To fight against me under Percy's pay, : None
3.2 :To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns, : None
3.2 :To show how much thou art degenerate. : None
PRINCE HENRY
3.2 :Do not think so; you shall not find it so: : None
3.2 :And God forgive them that so much have sway'd : None
3.2 :Your majesty's good thoughts away from me! : None
3.2 :I will redeem all this on Percy's head : None
3.2 :And in the closing of some glorious day : None
3.2 :Be bold to tell you that I am your son; : None
3.2 :When I will wear a garment all of blood : None
3.2 :And stain my favours in a bloody mask, : None

FALSTAFF
3.2 :Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make : None
3.2 :me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman : None
3.2 :need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not : None

PRINCE HENRY
3.2 :A trifle, some eight-penny matter. : None
HOSTESS

FALSTAFF
3.2 :What beast! why, an otter. : None
PRINCE HENRY

PRINCE HENRY

HOSTESS

PRINCE HENRY
3.2 :Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound? : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth : None

BARDOLPH
3.2 :Indeed, Sir John, you said so. : None
FALSTAFF

PRINCE HENRY
3.2 :O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy : None
3.2 :knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith, : None
3.2 :truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all : None
3.2 :filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest : None
3.2 :woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson, : None
3.2 :impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in : None
3.2 :thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of : None

3.2 :sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket : None
3.2 :were enriched with any other injuries but these, I : None

3.2 :not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed? : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of : None
3.2 :innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack : None
3.2 :Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I : None
3.2 :have more flesh than another man, and therefore more : None
3.2 :frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket? : None
PRINCE HENRY
3.2 :It appears so by the story. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast; : None
3.2 :love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy : None

EARL OF WORCESTER

MESSENGER
4.1 :He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth; : None

4.1 :'Tis catching hither, even to our camp. : None
4.1 :He writes me here, that inward sickness-- : None

EARL OF WORCESTER
4.1 :Your father's sickness is a maim to us. : None
HOTSPUR
4.1 :A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off: : None

4.1 :Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence: : None
4.1 :And think how such an apprehension : None
4.1 :May turn the tide of fearful faction : None

4.1 :It lends a lustre and more great opinion, : None
