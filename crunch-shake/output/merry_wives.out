2.2 :discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your : None
2.2 :place and person, generally allowed for your many : None
2.2 :war-like, court-like, and learned preparations. : None
FALSTAFF
2.2 :O, sir! : None
FORD

2.2 :Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously. : None
FORD
2.2 :O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on : None
2.2 :the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my : None
2.2 :soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to : None
2.2 :be looked against. Now, could I could come to her : None
2.2 :with any detection in my hand, my desires had : None
2.2 :instance and argument to commend themselves: I : None
2.2 :could drive her then from the ward of her purity, : None
2.2 :her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand : None
2.2 :other her defences, which now are too too strongly : None

2.2 :assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I : None
2.2 :shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at : None

2.2 :hour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man : None
2.2 :have thought this? See the hell of having a false : None
2.2 :woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers : None
2.2 :ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not : None
2.2 :only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under : None
2.2 :the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that : None
2.2 :does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds : None
2.2 :well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are : None
2.2 :devils' additions, the names of fiends: but : None
2.2 :Cuckold! Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hath : None
2.2 :not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he : None
2.2 :will trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will : None
2.2 :rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh : None
2.2 :the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my : None
2.2 :aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling : None

2.2 :then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they : None
