Enter NORFOLK at one door; at the other, BUCKINGHAM and ABERGAVENNY : ["Enter - ['NORFOLK', 'BUCKINGHAM', 'ABERGAVENNY']"] : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done : None
1.1 :Since last we saw in France? : None
NORFOLK
1.1 :I thank your grace, : None
1.1 :Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer : None
1.1 :Of what I saw there. : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :An untimely ague : None
1.1 :Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when : None
1.1 :Those suns of glory, those two lights of men, : None
1.1 :Met in the vale of Andren. : None
NORFOLK
1.1 :'Twixt Guynes and Arde: : None
1.1 :I was then present, saw them salute on horseback; : None
1.1 :Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung : None
1.1 :In their embracement, as they grew together; : None
1.1 :Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd : None
1.1 :Such a compounded one? : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :All the whole time : None
1.1 :I was my chamber's prisoner. : None
NORFOLK
1.1 :Then you lost : None
1.1 :The view of earthly glory: men might say, : None
1.1 :Till this time pomp was single, but now married : None
1.1 :To one above itself. Each following day : None
1.1 :Became the next day's master, till the last : None
1.1 :Made former wonders its. To-day the French, : None
1.1 :All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods, : None
1.1 :Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they : None
1.1 :Made Britain India: every man that stood : None
1.1 :Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were : None
1.1 :As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too, : None
1.1 :Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear : None
1.1 :The pride upon them, that their very labour : None
1.1 :Was to them as a painting: now this masque : None
1.1 :Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night : None
1.1 :Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings, : None
1.1 :Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst, : None
1.1 :As presence did present them; him in eye, : None
1.1 :Still him in praise: and, being present both : None
1.1 :'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner : None
1.1 :Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns-- : None
1.1 :For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged : None
1.1 :The noble spirits to arms, they did perform : None
1.1 :Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story, : None
1.1 :Being now seen possible enough, got credit, : None
1.1 :That Bevis was believed. : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :O, you go far. : None
NORFOLK
1.1 :As I belong to worship and affect : None
1.1 :In honour honesty, the tract of every thing : None
1.1 :Would by a good discourser lose some life, : None
1.1 :Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal; : None
1.1 :To the disposing of it nought rebell'd. : None
1.1 :Order gave each thing view; the office did : None
1.1 :Distinctly his full function. : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :Who did guide, : None
1.1 :I mean, who set the body and the limbs : None
1.1 :Of this great sport together, as you guess? : None
NORFOLK
1.1 :One, certes, that promises no element : None
1.1 :In such a business. : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :I pray you, who, my lord? : None
NORFOLK
1.1 :All this was order'd by the good discretion : None
1.1 :Of the right reverend Cardinal of York. : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed : None
1.1 :From his ambitious finger. What had he : None
1.1 :To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder : None
1.1 :That such a keech can with his very bulk : None
1.1 :Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun : None
1.1 :And keep it from the earth. : None
NORFOLK
1.1 :Surely, sir, : None
1.1 :There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends; : None
1.1 :For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace : None
1.1 :Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon : None
1.1 :For high feats done to the crown; neither allied : None
1.1 :For eminent assistants; but, spider-like, : None
1.1 :Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note, : None
1.1 :The force of his own merit makes his way : None
1.1 :A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys : None
1.1 :A place next to the king. : None
ABERGAVENNY
1.1 :I cannot tell : None
1.1 :What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye : None
1.1 :Pierce into that; but I can see his pride : None
1.1 :Peep through each part of him: whence has he that, : None
1.1 :If not from hell? the devil is a niggard, : None
1.1 :Or has given all before, and he begins : None
1.1 :A new hell in himself. : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :Why the devil, : None
1.1 :Upon this French going out, took he upon him, : None
1.1 :Without the privity o' the king, to appoint : None
1.1 :Who should attend on him? He makes up the file : None
1.1 :Of all the gentry; for the most part such : None
1.1 :To whom as great a charge as little honour : None
1.1 :He meant to lay upon: and his own letter, : None
1.1 :The honourable board of council out, : None
1.1 :Must fetch him in the papers. : None
ABERGAVENNY
1.1 :I do know : None
1.1 :Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have : None
1.1 :By this so sickened their estates, that never : None
1.1 :They shall abound as formerly. : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :O, many : None
1.1 :Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em : None
1.1 :For this great journey. What did this vanity : None
1.1 :But minister communication of : None
1.1 :A most poor issue? : None
NORFOLK
1.1 :                  Grievingly I think, : None
1.1 :The peace between the French and us not values : None
1.1 :The cost that did conclude it. : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :Every man, : None
1.1 :After the hideous storm that follow'd, was : None
1.1 :A thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke : None
1.1 :Into a general prophecy; That this tempest, : None
1.1 :Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded : None
1.1 :The sudden breach on't. : None
NORFOLK
1.1 :Which is budded out; : None
1.1 :For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd : None
1.1 :Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux. : None
ABERGAVENNY
1.1 :Is it therefore : None
1.1 :The ambassador is silenced? : None
NORFOLK
1.1 :Marry, is't. : None
ABERGAVENNY
1.1 :A proper title of a peace; and purchased : None
1.1 :At a superfluous rate! : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :Why, all this business : None
1.1 :Our reverend cardinal carried. : None
NORFOLK
1.1 :Like it your grace, : None
1.1 :The state takes notice of the private difference : None
1.1 :Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you-- : None
1.1 :And take it from a heart that wishes towards you : None
1.1 :Honour and plenteous safety--that you read : None
1.1 :The cardinal's malice and his potency : None
1.1 :Together; to consider further that : None
1.1 :What his high hatred would effect wants not : None
1.1 :A minister in his power. You know his nature, : None
1.1 :That he's revengeful, and I know his sword : None
1.1 :Hath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said, : None
1.1 :It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend, : None
1.1 :Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel, : None
1.1 :You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock : None
1.1 :That I advise your shunning. : None
Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before him,  certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries with  papers. CARDINAL WOLSEY in his passage fixeth his  eye on BUCKINGHAM, and BUCKINGHAM on him, both full of disdain : ["Enter - ['CARDINAL WOLSEY']", "None - ['CARDINAL WOLSEY', 'BUCKINGHAM', 'BUCKINGHAM', 'BOTH']"] : NORFOLK
CARDINAL WOLSEY
1.1 :The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha? : None
1.1 :Where's his examination? : None
FIRST SECRETARY
1.1 :Here, so please you. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
1.1 :Is he in person ready? : None
FIRST SECRETARY
1.1 :Ay, please your grace. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
1.1 :Well, we shall then know more; and Buckingham : None
1.1 :Shall lessen this big look. : None
Exeunt CARDINAL WOLSEY and his Train : ["Exeunt - ['CARDINAL WOLSEY']"] : CARDINAL WOLSEY
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I : None
1.1 :Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best : None
1.1 :Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book : None
1.1 :Outworths a noble's blood. : None
NORFOLK
1.1 :What, are you chafed? : None
1.1 :Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance only : None
1.1 :Which your disease requires. : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :I read in's looks : None
1.1 :Matter against me; and his eye reviled : None
1.1 :Me, as his abject object: at this instant : None
1.1 :He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king; : None
1.1 :I'll follow and outstare him. : None
NORFOLK
1.1 :Stay, my lord, : None
1.1 :And let your reason with your choler question : None
1.1 :What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills : None
1.1 :Requires slow pace at first: anger is like : None
1.1 :A full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way, : None
1.1 :Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England : None
1.1 :Can advise me like you: be to yourself : None
1.1 :As you would to your friend. : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :I'll to the king; : None
1.1 :And from a mouth of honour quite cry down : None
1.1 :This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim : None
1.1 :There's difference in no persons. : None
NORFOLK
1.1 :Be advised; : None
1.1 :Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot : None
1.1 :That it do singe yourself: we may outrun, : None
1.1 :By violent swiftness, that which we run at, : None
1.1 :And lose by over-running. Know you not, : None
1.1 :The fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er, : None
1.1 :In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised: : None
1.1 :I say again, there is no English soul : None
1.1 :More stronger to direct you than yourself, : None
1.1 :If with the sap of reason you would quench, : None
1.1 :Or but allay, the fire of passion. : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :Sir, : None
1.1 :I am thankful to you; and I'll go along : None
1.1 :By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow, : None
1.1 :Whom from the flow of gall I name not but : None
1.1 :From sincere motions, by intelligence, : None
1.1 :And proofs as clear as founts in July when : None
1.1 :We see each grain of gravel, I do know : None
1.1 :To be corrupt and treasonous. : None
NORFOLK
1.1 :Say not 'treasonous.' : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :To the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strong : None
1.1 :As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox, : None
1.1 :Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous : None
1.1 :As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief : None
1.1 :As able to perform't; his mind and place : None
1.1 :Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally-- : None
1.1 :Only to show his pomp as well in France : None
1.1 :As here at home, suggests the king our master : None
1.1 :To this last costly treaty, the interview, : None
1.1 :That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass : None
1.1 :Did break i' the rinsing. : None
NORFOLK
1.1 :Faith, and so it did. : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal : None
1.1 :The articles o' the combination drew : None
1.1 :As himself pleased; and they were ratified : None
1.1 :As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end : None
1.1 :As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal : None
1.1 :Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey, : None
1.1 :Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,-- : None
1.1 :Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy : None
1.1 :To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor, : None
1.1 :Under pretence to see the queen his aunt-- : None
1.1 :For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came : None
1.1 :To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation: : None
1.1 :His fears were, that the interview betwixt : None
1.1 :England and France might, through their amity, : None
1.1 :Breed him some prejudice; for from this league : None
1.1 :Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily : None
1.1 :Deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,-- : None
1.1 :Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor : None
1.1 :Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted : None
1.1 :Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made, : None
1.1 :And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired, : None
1.1 :That he would please to alter the king's course, : None
1.1 :And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know, : None
1.1 :As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal : None
1.1 :Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases, : None
1.1 :And for his own advantage. : None
NORFOLK
1.1 :I am sorry : None
1.1 :To hear this of him; and could wish he were : None
1.1 :Something mistaken in't. : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :No, not a syllable: : None
1.1 :I  do pronounce him in that very shape : None
1.1 :He shall appear in proof. : None
Enter BRANDON, a Sergeant-at-arms before him, and two or three of the Guard : ["Enter - ['BRANDON', 'SERGEANT']"] : BUCKINGHAM
BRANDON
1.1 :Your office, sergeant; execute it. : None
SERGEANT
1.1 :Sir, : None
1.1 :My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl : None
1.1 :Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I : None
1.1 :Arrest thee of high treason, in the name : None
1.1 :Of our most sovereign king. : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :Lo, you, my lord, : None
1.1 :The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish : None
1.1 :Under device and practise. : None
BRANDON
1.1 :I am sorry : None
1.1 :To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on : None
1.1 :The business present: 'tis his highness' pleasure : None
1.1 :You shall to the Tower. : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :It will help me nothing : None
1.1 :To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me : None
1.1 :Which makes my whitest part black. The will of heaven : None
1.1 :Be done in this and all things! I obey. : None
1.1 :O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well! : None
BRANDON
1.1 :Nay, he must bear you company. The king : None
To ABERGAVENNY : ["To - ['ABERGAVENNY']"] : BRANDON
1.1 :Is pleased you shall to the Tower, till you know : None
1.1 :How he determines further. : None
ABERGAVENNY
1.1 :As the duke said, : None
1.1 :The will of heaven be done, and the king's pleasure : None
1.1 :By me obey'd! : None
BRANDON
1.1 :                  Here is a warrant from : None
1.1 :The king to attach Lord Montacute; and the bodies : None
1.1 :Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car, : None
1.1 :One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor-- : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :So, so; : None
1.1 :These are the limbs o' the plot: no more, I hope. : None
BRANDON
1.1 :A monk o' the Chartreux. : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :O, Nicholas Hopkins? : None
BRANDON
1.1 :He. : None
BUCKINGHAM
1.1 :My surveyor is false; the o'er-great cardinal : None
1.1 :Hath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already: : None
1.1 :I am the shadow of poor Buckingham, : None
1.1 :Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on, : None
1.1 :By darkening my clear sun. My lord, farewell. : None
Exeunt : ['Exeunt - []'] : BUCKINGHAM
Scene(scene=2)
Cornets. Enter KING HENRY VIII, leaning on  CARDINAL WOLSEY's shoulder, the Nobles, and LOVELL;  CARDINAL WOLSEY places himself under KING HENRY VIII's feet on his right side : ['None - []', "Enter - ['KING HENRY VIII', 'CARDINAL WOLSEY', 'LOVELL', 'CARDINAL WOLSEY', 'KING HENRY VIII']"] : BUCKINGHAM
KING HENRY VIII
1.2 :My life itself, and the best heart of it, : None
1.2 :Thanks you for this great care: I stood i' the level : None
1.2 :Of a full-charged confederacy, and give thanks : None
1.2 :To you that choked it. Let be call'd before us : None
1.2 :That gentleman of Buckingham's; in person : None
1.2 :I'll hear him his confessions justify; : None
1.2 :And point by point the treasons of his master : None
1.2 :He shall again relate. : None
A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!' Enter  QUEEN KATHARINE, ushered by NORFOLK, and SUFFOLK:  she kneels. KING HENRY VIII riseth from his state, takes her up, kisses and placeth her by him : ["Enter - ['QUEEN KATHARINE', 'NORFOLK', 'SUFFOLK']", "None - ['KING HENRY VIII']"] : KING HENRY VIII
QUEEN KATHARINE
1.2 :Nay, we must longer kneel: I am a suitor. : None
KING HENRY VIII
1.2 :Arise, and take place by us: half your suit : None
1.2 :Never name to us; you have half our power: : None
1.2 :The other moiety, ere you ask, is given; : None
1.2 :Repeat your will and take it. : None
QUEEN KATHARINE
1.2 :Thank your majesty. : None
1.2 :That you would love yourself, and in that love : None
1.2 :Not unconsider'd leave your honour, nor : None
1.2 :The dignity of your office, is the point : None
1.2 :Of my petition. : None
KING HENRY VIII
1.2 :                  Lady mine, proceed. : None
QUEEN KATHARINE
1.2 :I am solicited, not by a few, : None
1.2 :And those of true condition, that your subjects : None
1.2 :Are in great grievance: there have been commissions : None
1.2 :Sent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart : None
1.2 :Of all their loyalties: wherein, although, : None
1.2 :My good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches : None
1.2 :Most bitterly on you, as putter on : None
1.2 :Of these exactions, yet the king our master-- : None
1.2 :Whose honour heaven shield from soil!--even he : None
1.2 :escapes not : None
1.2 :Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks : None
1.2 :The sides of loyalty, and almost appears : None
1.2 :In loud rebellion. : None
NORFOLK
1.2 :                  Not almost appears, : None
1.2 :It doth appear; for, upon these taxations, : None
1.2 :The clothiers all, not able to maintain : None
1.2 :The many to them longing, have put off : None
1.2 :The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who, : None
1.2 :Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger : None
1.2 :And lack of other means, in desperate manner : None
1.2 :Daring the event to the teeth, are all in uproar, : None
1.2 :And danger serves among then! : None
KING HENRY VIII
1.2 :Taxation! : None
1.2 :Wherein? and what taxation? My lord cardinal, : None
1.2 :You that are blamed for it alike with us, : None
1.2 :Know you of this taxation? : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
1.2 :Please you, sir, : None
1.2 :I know but of a single part, in aught : None
1.2 :Pertains to the state; and front but in that file : None
1.2 :Where others tell steps with me. : None
QUEEN KATHARINE
1.2 :No, my lord, : None
1.2 :You know no more than others; but you frame : None
1.2 :Things that are known alike; which are not wholesome : None
1.2 :To those which would not know them, and yet must : None
1.2 :Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions, : None
1.2 :Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are : None
1.2 :Most pestilent to the bearing; and, to bear 'em, : None
1.2 :The back is sacrifice to the load. They say : None
1.2 :They are devised by you; or else you suffer : None
1.2 :Too hard an exclamation. : None
KING HENRY VIII
1.2 :Still exaction! : None
1.2 :The nature of it? in what kind, let's know, : None
1.2 :Is this exaction? : None
QUEEN KATHARINE
1.2 :                  I am much too venturous : None
1.2 :In tempting of your patience; but am bolden'd : None
1.2 :Under your promised pardon. The subjects' grief : None
1.2 :Comes through commissions, which compel from each : None
1.2 :The sixth part of his substance, to be levied : None
1.2 :Without delay; and the pretence for this : None
1.2 :Is named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths: : None
1.2 :Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze : None
1.2 :Allegiance in them; their curses now : None
1.2 :Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass, : None
1.2 :This tractable obedience is a slave : None
1.2 :To each incensed will. I would your highness : None
1.2 :Would give it quick consideration, for : None
1.2 :There is no primer business. : None
KING HENRY VIII
1.2 :By my life, : None
1.2 :This is against our pleasure. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
1.2 :And for me, : None
1.2 :I have no further gone in this than by : None
1.2 :A single voice; and that not pass'd me but : None
1.2 :By learned approbation of the judges. If I am : None
1.2 :Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know : None
1.2 :My faculties nor person, yet will be : None
1.2 :The chronicles of my doing, let me say : None
1.2 :'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake : None
1.2 :That virtue must go through. We must not stint : None
1.2 :Our necessary actions, in the fear : None
1.2 :To cope malicious censurers; which ever, : None
1.2 :As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow : None
1.2 :That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further : None
1.2 :Than vainly longing. What we oft do best, : None
1.2 :By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is : None
1.2 :Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft, : None
1.2 :Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up : None
1.2 :For our best act. If we shall stand still, : None
1.2 :In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at, : None
1.2 :We should take root here where we sit, or sit : None
1.2 :State-statues only. : None
KING HENRY VIII
1.2 :Things done well, : None
1.2 :And with a care, exempt themselves from fear; : None
1.2 :Things done without example, in their issue : None
1.2 :Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent : None
1.2 :Of this commission? I believe, not any. : None
1.2 :We must not rend our subjects from our laws, : None
1.2 :And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each? : None
1.2 :A trembling contribution! Why, we take : None
1.2 :From every tree lop, bark, and part o' the timber; : None
1.2 :And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd, : None
1.2 :The air will drink the sap. To every county : None
1.2 :Where this is question'd send our letters, with : None
1.2 :Free pardon to each man that has denied : None
1.2 :The force of this commission: pray, look to't; : None
1.2 :I put it to your care. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
1.2 :A word with you. : None
To the Secretary : ['To - []'] : CARDINAL WOLSEY
1.2 :Let there be letters writ to every shire, : None
1.2 :Of the king's grace and pardon. The grieved commons : None
1.2 :Hardly conceive of me; let it be noised : None
1.2 :That through our intercession this revokement : None
1.2 :And pardon comes: I shall anon advise you : None
1.2 :Further in the proceeding. : None
Exit Secretary : ['Exit - []'] : CARDINAL WOLSEY
Enter Surveyor : ["Enter - ['SURVEYOR']"] : CARDINAL WOLSEY
QUEEN KATHARINE
1.2 :I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham : None
1.2 :Is run in your displeasure. : None
KING HENRY VIII
1.2 :It grieves many: : None
1.2 :The gentleman is learn'd, and a most rare speaker; : None
1.2 :To nature none more bound; his training such, : None
1.2 :That he may furnish and instruct great teachers, : None
1.2 :And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see, : None
1.2 :When these so noble benefits shall prove : None
1.2 :Not well disposed, the mind growing once corrupt, : None
1.2 :They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly : None
1.2 :Than ever they were fair. This man so complete, : None

2.4 :Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't: : None
2.4 :My conscience first received a tenderness, : None

2.4 :Wherein he might the king his lord advertise : None

2.4 :Respecting this our marriage with the dowager, : None
2.4 :Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook : None
2.4 :The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me, : None
2.4 :Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble : None
2.4 :The region of my breast; which forced such way, : None
2.4 :That many mazed considerings did throng : None

2.4 :The grave does to the dead; for her male issue : None
2.4 :Or died where they were made, or shortly after : None
2.4 :This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought, : None
2.4 :This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom, : None
2.4 :Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not : None
2.4 :Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that : None
2.4 :I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in : None
2.4 :By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me : None
2.4 :Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in : None
2.4 :The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer : None
2.4 :Toward this remedy, whereupon we are : None
2.4 :Now present here together: that's to say, : None
2.4 :I meant to rectify my conscience,--which : None
2.4 :I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,-- : None
2.4 :By all the reverend fathers of the land : None
2.4 :And doctors learn'd: first I began in private : None

2.4 :But by particular consent proceeded : None
2.4 :Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on: : None
2.4 :For no dislike i' the world against the person : None
2.4 :Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points : None
2.4 :Of my alleged reasons, drive this forward: : None
2.4 :Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life : None
2.4 :And kingly dignity, we are contented : None
2.4 :To wear our mortal state to come with her, : None
2.4 :Katharine our queen, before the primest creature : None

CARDINAL CAMPEIUS
2.4 :So please your highness, : None
2.4 :The queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness : None
2.4 :That we adjourn this court till further day: : None
2.4 :Meanwhile must be an earnest motion : None
2.4 :Made to the queen, to call back her appeal : None
2.4 :She intends unto his holiness. : None

3.2 :And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence! : None
3.2 :Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil : None
3.2 :Made me put this main secret in the packet : None
3.2 :I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this? : None
3.2 :No new device to beat this from his brains? : None
3.2 :I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know : None
3.2 :A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune : None
3.2 :Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To the Pope!' : None
3.2 :The letter, as I live, with all the business : None
3.2 :I writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell! : None
3.2 :I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness; : None
3.2 :And, from that full meridian of my glory, : None
3.2 :I haste now to my setting: I shall fall : None
3.2 :Like a bright exhalation m the evening, : None
3.2 :And no man see me more. : None

3.2 :To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's, : None
3.2 :Till you hear further from his highness. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :Stay: : None
3.2 :Where's your commission, lords? words cannot carry : None
3.2 :Authority so weighty. : None
SUFFOLK
3.2 :Who dare cross 'em, : None
3.2 :Bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly? : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :Till I find more than will or words to do it, : None
3.2 :I mean your malice, know, officious lords, : None
3.2 :I dare and must deny it. Now I feel : None
3.2 :Of what coarse metal ye are moulded, envy: : None
3.2 :How eagerly ye follow my disgraces, : None
3.2 :As if it fed ye! and how sleek and wanton : None
3.2 :Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin! : None
3.2 :Follow your envious courses, men of malice; : None
3.2 :You have Christian warrant for 'em, and, no doubt, : None
3.2 :In time will find their fit rewards. That seal, : None
3.2 :You ask with such a violence, the king, : None
3.2 :Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me; : None
3.2 :Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours, : None
3.2 :During my life; and, to confirm his goodness, : None
3.2 :Tied it by letters-patents: now, who'll take it? : None
SURREY
3.2 :The king, that gave it. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :It must be himself, then. : None
SURREY
3.2 :Thou art a proud traitor, priest. : None

SURREY
3.2 :Thy ambition, : None

3.2 :Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law: : None
3.2 :The heads of all thy brother cardinals, : None
3.2 :With thee and all thy best parts bound together, : None
3.2 :Weigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy! : None
3.2 :You sent me deputy for Ireland; : None
3.2 :Far from his succor, from the king, from all : None
3.2 :That might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him; : None
3.2 :Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity, : None
3.2 :Absolved him with an axe. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :This, and all else : None
3.2 :This talking lord can lay upon my credit, : None
3.2 :I answer is most false. The duke by law : None
3.2 :Found his deserts: how innocent I was : None
3.2 :From any private malice in his end, : None
3.2 :His noble jury and foul cause can witness. : None
3.2 :If I loved many words, lord, I should tell you : None
3.2 :You have as little honesty as honour, : None
3.2 :That in the way of loyalty and truth : None
3.2 :Toward the king, my ever royal master, : None
3.2 :Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be, : None
3.2 :And all that love his follies. : None
SURREY
3.2 :By my soul, : None
3.2 :Your long coat, priest, protects you; thou : None
3.2 :shouldst feel : None
3.2 :My sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords, : None
3.2 :Can ye endure to hear this arrogance? : None
3.2 :And from this fellow? if we live thus tamely, : None
3.2 :To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet, : None
3.2 :Farewell nobility; let his grace go forward, : None
3.2 :And dare us with his cap like larks. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :All goodness : None
3.2 :Is poison to thy stomach. : None
SURREY
3.2 :Yes, that goodness : None
3.2 :Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one, : None
3.2 :Into your own hands, cardinal, by extortion; : None
3.2 :The goodness of your intercepted packets : None
3.2 :You writ to the pope against the king: your goodness, : None
3.2 :Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious. : None
3.2 :My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble, : None
3.2 :As you respect the common good, the state : None
3.2 :Of our despised nobility, our issues, : None
3.2 :Who, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen, : None
3.2 :Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles : None
3.2 :Collected from his life. I'll startle you : None
3.2 :Worse than the scaring bell, when the brown wench : None
3.2 :Lay kissing in your arms, lord cardinal. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :How much, methinks, I could despise this man, : None
3.2 :But that I am bound in charity against it! : None
NORFOLK
3.2 :Those articles, my lord, are in the king's hand: : None
3.2 :But, thus much, they are foul ones. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :So much fairer : None
3.2 :And spotless shall mine innocence arise, : None
3.2 :When the king knows my truth. : None
SURREY
3.2 :This cannot save you: : None
3.2 :I thank my memory, I yet remember : None
3.2 :Some of these articles; and out they shall. : None
3.2 :Now, if you can blush and cry 'guilty,' cardinal, : None
3.2 :You'll show a little honesty. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :Speak on, sir; : None
3.2 :I dare your worst objections: if I blush, : None
3.2 :It is to see a nobleman want manners. : None
SURREY
3.2 :I had rather want those than my head. Have at you! : None
3.2 :First, that, without the king's assent or knowledge, : None
3.2 :You wrought to be a legate; by which power : None
3.2 :You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops. : None
NORFOLK
3.2 :Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else : None
3.2 :To foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus' : None
3.2 :Was still inscribed; in which you brought the king : None
3.2 :To be your servant. : None
SUFFOLK
3.2 :Then that, without the knowledge : None
3.2 :Either of king or council, when you went : None
3.2 :Ambassador to the emperor, you made bold : None
3.2 :To carry into Flanders the great seal. : None
SURREY
3.2 :Item, you sent a large commission : None
3.2 :To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude, : None
3.2 :Without the king's will or the state's allowance, : None
3.2 :A league between his highness and Ferrara. : None
SUFFOLK
3.2 :That, out of mere ambition, you have caused : None
3.2 :Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin. : None
SURREY
3.2 :Then that you have sent innumerable substance-- : None
3.2 :By what means got, I leave to your own conscience-- : None
3.2 :To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways : None
3.2 :You have for dignities; to the mere undoing : None
3.2 :Of all the kingdom. Many more there are; : None
3.2 :Which, since they are of you, and odious, : None
3.2 :I will not taint my mouth with. : None
CHAMBERLAIN
3.2 :O my lord, : None
3.2 :Press not a falling man too far! 'tis virtue: : None
3.2 :His faults lie open to the laws; let them, : None
3.2 :Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him : None
3.2 :So little of his great self. : None
SURREY
3.2 :I forgive him. : None
SUFFOLK
3.2 :Lord cardinal, the king's further pleasure is, : None
3.2 :Because all those things you have done of late, : None
3.2 :By your power legatine, within this kingdom, : None
3.2 :Fall into the compass of a praemunire, : None
3.2 :That therefore such a writ be sued against you; : None
3.2 :To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements, : None
3.2 :Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be : None
3.2 :Out of the king's protection. This is my charge. : None
NORFOLK
3.2 :And so we'll leave you to your meditations : None
3.2 :How to live better. For your stubborn answer : None
3.2 :About the giving back the great seal to us, : None
3.2 :The king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you. : None
3.2 :So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal. : None

CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :So farewell to the little good you bear me. : None
3.2 :Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness! : None
3.2 :This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth : None
3.2 :The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms, : None
3.2 :And bears his blushing honours thick upon him; : None
3.2 :The third day comes a frost, a killing frost, : None
3.2 :And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely : None
3.2 :His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root, : None
3.2 :And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured, : None
3.2 :Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders, : None
3.2 :This many summers in a sea of glory, : None
3.2 :But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride : None
3.2 :At length broke under me and now has left me, : None
3.2 :Weary and old with service, to the mercy : None
3.2 :Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me. : None
3.2 :Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye: : None
3.2 :I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched : None
3.2 :Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours! : None
3.2 :There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to, : None
3.2 :That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin, : None
3.2 :More pangs and fears than wars or women have: : None
3.2 :And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer, : None
3.2 :Never to hope again. : None
Enter CROMWELL, and stands amazed : ["Enter - ['CROMWELL']"] : CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :Why, how now, Cromwell! : None
CROMWELL
3.2 :I have no power to speak, sir. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :What, amazed : None
3.2 :At my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder : None
3.2 :A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep, : None
3.2 :I am fall'n indeed. : None
CROMWELL
3.2 :How does your grace? : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :Why, well; : None
3.2 :Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell. : None
3.2 :I know myself now; and I feel within me : None
3.2 :A peace above all earthly dignities, : None
3.2 :A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me, : None
3.2 :I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders, : None
3.2 :These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken : None
3.2 :A load would sink a navy, too much honour: : None
3.2 :O, 'tis a burthen, Cromwell, 'tis a burthen : None
3.2 :Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven! : None
CROMWELL
3.2 :I am glad your grace has made that right use of it. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :I hope I have: I am able now, methinks, : None
3.2 :Out of a fortitude of soul I feel, : None
3.2 :To endure more miseries and greater far : None
3.2 :Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer. : None
3.2 :What news abroad? : None
CROMWELL
3.2 :                  The heaviest and the worst : None
3.2 :Is your displeasure with the king. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :God bless him! : None
CROMWELL
3.2 :The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen : None
3.2 :Lord chancellor in your place. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :That's somewhat sudden: : None
3.2 :But he's a learned man. May he continue : None
3.2 :Long in his highness' favour, and do justice : None
3.2 :For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones, : None
3.2 :When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings, : None
3.2 :May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em! What more? : None
CROMWELL
3.2 :That Cranmer is return'd with welcome, : None
3.2 :Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :That's news indeed. : None
CROMWELL
3.2 :Last, that the Lady Anne, : None
3.2 :Whom the king hath in secrecy long married, : None
3.2 :This day was view'd in open as his queen, : None
3.2 :Going to chapel; and the voice is now : None
3.2 :Only about her coronation. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :There was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell, : None
3.2 :The king has gone beyond me: all my glories : None
3.2 :In that one woman I have lost for ever: : None
3.2 :No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours, : None
3.2 :Or gild again the noble troops that waited : None
3.2 :Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell; : None
3.2 :I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now : None
3.2 :To be thy lord and master: seek the king; : None
3.2 :That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him : None
3.2 :What and how true thou art: he will advance thee; : None
3.2 :Some little memory of me will stir him-- : None
3.2 :I know his noble nature--not to let : None
3.2 :Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell, : None
3.2 :Neglect him not; make use now, and provide : None
3.2 :For thine own future safety. : None
CROMWELL
3.2 :O my lord, : None
3.2 :Must I, then, leave you? must I needs forego : None
3.2 :So good, so noble and so true a master? : None
3.2 :Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron, : None
3.2 :With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord. : None
3.2 :The king shall have my service: but my prayers : None
3.2 :For ever and for ever shall be yours. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear : None
3.2 :In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me, : None
3.2 :Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman. : None
3.2 :Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell; : None
3.2 :And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be, : None
3.2 :And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention : None
3.2 :Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee, : None
3.2 :Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory, : None
3.2 :And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour, : None
3.2 :Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in; : None
3.2 :A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it. : None
3.2 :Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me. : None
3.2 :Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition: : None
3.2 :By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then, : None
3.2 :The image of his Maker, hope to win by it? : None
3.2 :Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee; : None
3.2 :Corruption wins not more than honesty. : None
3.2 :Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace, : None
3.2 :To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not: : None
3.2 :Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's, : None
3.2 :Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, : None
3.2 :O Cromwell, : None
3.2 :Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king; : None
3.2 :And,--prithee, lead me in: : None
3.2 :There take an inventory of all I have, : None
3.2 :To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe, : None
3.2 :And my integrity to heaven, is all : None
3.2 :I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell! : None
3.2 :Had I but served my God with half the zeal : None
3.2 :I served my king, he would not in mine age : None
3.2 :Have left me naked to mine enemies. : None
CROMWELL
3.2 :Good sir, have patience. : None
CARDINAL WOLSEY
3.2 :So I have. Farewell : None
3.2 :The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell. : None

4.1 :Pageants and sights of honour. : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN

4.1 :That paper in your hand? : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
4.1 :Yes; 'tis the list : None
4.1 :Of those that claim their offices this day : None
4.1 :By custom of the coronation. : None

4.1 :To be high-steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk, : None
4.1 :He to be earl marshal: you may read the rest. : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN
4.1 :I thank you, sir: had I not known those customs, : None
4.1 :I should have been beholding to your paper. : None
4.1 :But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine, : None
4.1 :The princess dowager? how goes her business? : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN

4.1 :Learned and reverend fathers of his order, : None
4.1 :Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off : None
4.1 :From Ampthill where the princess lay; to which : None
4.1 :She was often cited by them, but appear'd not: : None
4.1 :And, to be short, for not appearance and : None
4.1 :The king's late scruple, by the main assent : None
4.1 :Of all these learned men she was divorced, : None
4.1 :And the late marriage made of none effect : None
4.1 :Since which she was removed to Kimbolton, : None
4.1 :Where she remains now sick. : None

4.1 :circlets of gold without flowers. : None
They pass over the stage in order and state : ['None - []'] : SECOND GENTLEMAN
SECOND GENTLEMAN
4.1 :A royal train, believe me. These I know: : None
4.1 :Who's that that bears the sceptre? : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
4.1 :Marquess Dorset: : None
4.1 :And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod. : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN
4.1 :A bold brave gentleman. That should be : None
4.1 :The Duke of Suffolk? : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
4.1 :'Tis the same: high-steward. : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN
4.1 :And that my Lord of Norfolk? : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
4.1 :Yes; : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN
4.1 :Heaven bless thee! : None
Looking on QUEEN ANNE : ["None - ['ANNE']"] : SECOND GENTLEMAN
4.1 :Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on. : None
4.1 :Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel; : None
4.1 :Our king has all the Indies in his arms, : None
4.1 :And more and richer, when he strains that lady: : None
4.1 :I cannot blame his conscience. : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
4.1 :They that bear : None
4.1 :The cloth of honour over her, are four barons : None
4.1 :Of the Cinque-ports. : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN
4.1 :Those men are happy; and so are all are near her. : None
4.1 :I take it, she that carries up the train : None
4.1 :Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk. : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
4.1 :It is; and all the rest are countesses. : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN

Exit procession, and then a great flourish of trumpets : ['Exit - []'] : FIRST GENTLEMAN
Enter a third Gentleman : ["Enter - ['THIRD GENTLEMAN']"] : FIRST GENTLEMAN
FIRST GENTLEMAN
4.1 :God save you, sir! where have you been broiling? : None
THIRD GENTLEMAN
4.1 :Among the crowd i' the Abbey; where a finger : None
4.1 :Could not be wedged in more: I am stifled : None
4.1 :With the mere rankness of their joy. : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN
4.1 :You saw : None
4.1 :The ceremony? : None
THIRD GENTLEMAN
4.1 :                  That I did. : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
4.1 :How was it? : None
THIRD GENTLEMAN
4.1 :Well worth the seeing. : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN
4.1 :Good sir, speak it to us. : None
THIRD GENTLEMAN
4.1 :As well as I am able. The rich stream : None
4.1 :Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen : None
4.1 :To a prepared place in the choir, fell off : None
4.1 :A distance from her; while her grace sat down : None
4.1 :To rest awhile, some half an hour or so, : None
4.1 :In a rich chair of state, opposing freely : None
4.1 :The beauty of her person to the people. : None
4.1 :Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman : None
4.1 :That ever lay by man: which when the people : None
4.1 :Had the full view of, such a noise arose : None
4.1 :As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest, : None
4.1 :As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks-- : None
4.1 :Doublets, I think,--flew up; and had their faces : None
4.1 :Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy : None
4.1 :I never saw before. Great-bellied women, : None
4.1 :That had not half a week to go, like rams : None
4.1 :In the old time of war, would shake the press, : None
4.1 :And make 'em reel before 'em. No man living : None
4.1 :Could say 'This is my wife' there; all were woven : None

FIRST GENTLEMAN

GRIFFITH
4.2 :How does your grace? : None
KATHARINE
4.2 :O Griffith, sick to death! : None
4.2 :My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth, : None
4.2 :Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair: : None
4.2 :So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease. : None
4.2 :Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me, : None
4.2 :That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead? : None
GRIFFITH
4.2 :        Yes, madam; but I think your grace, : None

KATHARINE
4.2 :Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died: : None
4.2 :If well, he stepp'd before me, happily : None
4.2 :For my example. : None
GRIFFITH
4.2 :                  Well, the voice goes, madam: : None
4.2 :For after the stout Earl Northumberland : None
4.2 :Arrested him at York, and brought him forward, : None
4.2 :As a man sorely tainted, to his answer, : None
4.2 :He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill : None
4.2 :He could not sit his mule. : None
KATHARINE
4.2 :Alas, poor man! : None
GRIFFITH
4.2 :At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester, : None
4.2 :Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot, : None
4.2 :With all his covent, honourably received him; : None
4.2 :To whom he gave these words, 'O, father abbot, : None
4.2 :An old man, broken with the storms of state, : None
4.2 :Is come to lay his weary bones among ye; : None
4.2 :Give him a little earth for charity!' : None
4.2 :So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness : None
4.2 :Pursued him still: and, three nights after this, : None
4.2 :About the hour of eight, which he himself : None
4.2 :Foretold should be his last, full of repentance, : None
4.2 :Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows, : None
4.2 :He gave his honours to the world again, : None
4.2 :His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace. : None
KATHARINE
4.2 :So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him! : None
4.2 :Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him, : None
4.2 :And yet with charity. He was a man : None
4.2 :Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking : None
4.2 :Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion, : None
4.2 :Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play; : None
4.2 :His own opinion was his law: i' the presence : None
4.2 :He would say untruths; and be ever double : None
4.2 :Both in his words and meaning: he was never, : None
4.2 :But where he meant to ruin, pitiful: : None
4.2 :His promises were, as he then was, mighty; : None
4.2 :But his performance, as he is now, nothing: : None
4.2 :Of his own body he was ill, and gave : None
4.2 :The clergy in example. : None
GRIFFITH
4.2 :Noble madam, : None
4.2 :Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues : None
4.2 :We write in water. May it please your highness : None
4.2 :To hear me speak his good now? : None
KATHARINE
4.2 :Yes, good Griffith; : None
4.2 :I were malicious else. : None
GRIFFITH
4.2 :This cardinal, : None
4.2 :Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly : None
4.2 :Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle. : None
4.2 :He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one; : None
4.2 :Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading: : None
4.2 :Lofty and sour to them that loved him not; : None
4.2 :But to those men that sought him sweet as summer. : None
4.2 :And though he were unsatisfied in getting, : None
4.2 :Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam, : None
4.2 :He was most princely: ever witness for him : None
4.2 :Those twins Of learning that he raised in you, : None
4.2 :Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him, : None
4.2 :Unwilling to outlive the good that did it; : None
4.2 :The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous, : None
4.2 :So excellent in art, and still so rising, : None
4.2 :That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue. : None
4.2 :His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him; : None
4.2 :For then, and not till then, he felt himself, : None
4.2 :And found the blessedness of being little: : None
4.2 :And, to add greater honours to his age : None
4.2 :Than man could give him, he died fearing God. : None
KATHARINE
4.2 :After my death I wish no other herald, : None
4.2 :No other speaker of my living actions, : None
4.2 :To keep mine honour from corruption, : None
4.2 :But such an honest chronicler as Griffith. : None
4.2 :Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me, : None
4.2 :With thy religious truth and modesty, : None
4.2 :Now in his ashes honour: peace be with him! : None
4.2 :Patience, be near me still; and set me lower: : None
4.2 :I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith, : None
4.2 :Cause the musicians play me that sad note : None
4.2 :I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating : None
4.2 :On that celestial harmony I go to. : None

The vision. Enter, solemnly tripping one after  another, six personages, clad in white robes,  wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and golden  vizards on their faces; branches of bays or palm in  their hands. They first congee unto her, then  dance; and, at certain changes, the first two hold  a spare garland over her head; at which the other  four make reverent curtsies; then the two that held  the garland deliver the same to the other next two,  who observe the same order in their changes, and  holding the garland over her head: which done,  they deliver the same garland to the last two, who  likewise observe the same order: at which, as it  were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs  of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven:  and so in their dancing vanish, carrying the garland with them.

5.3 :Which reformation must be sudden too, : None
5.3 :My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses : None
