Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND : ["Enter - ['KENT', 'GLOUCESTER', 'EDMUND']"] : None
KENT
1.1 :I thought the king had more affected the Duke of : None
1.1 :Albany than Cornwall. : None
GLOUCESTER
1.1 :It did always seem so to us: but now, in the : None
1.1 :division of the kingdom, it appears not which of : None
1.1 :the dukes he values most; for equalities are so : None
1.1 :weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice : None
1.1 :of either's moiety. : None
KENT
1.1 :Is not this your son, my lord? : None
GLOUCESTER
1.1 :His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have : None
1.1 :so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am : None
1.1 :brazed to it. : None
KENT
1.1 :I cannot conceive you. : None
GLOUCESTER
1.1 :Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon : None
1.1 :she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son : None
1.1 :for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed. : None
1.1 :Do you smell a fault? : None
KENT
1.1 :I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it : None
1.1 :being so proper. : None
GLOUCESTER
1.1 :But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year : None
1.1 :elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account: : None
1.1 :though this knave came something saucily into the : None
1.1 :world before he was sent for, yet was his mother : None
1.1 :fair; there was good sport at his making, and the : None
1.1 :whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this : None
1.1 :noble gentleman, Edmund? : None
EDMUND
1.1 :No, my lord. : None
GLOUCESTER
1.1 :My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my : None
1.1 :honourable friend. : None

EDMUND

KING LEAR
1.1 :Meantime we shall express our darker purpose. : None
1.1 :Give me the map there. Know that we have divided : None
1.1 :In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent : None
1.1 :To shake all cares and business from our age; : None
1.1 :Conferring them on younger strengths, while we : None
1.1 :Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall, : None
1.1 :And you, our no less loving son of Albany, : None
1.1 :We have this hour a constant will to publish : None
1.1 :Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife : None
1.1 :May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy, : None
1.1 :Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love, : None
1.1 :Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn, : None
1.1 :And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,-- : None
1.1 :Since now we will divest us both of rule, : None
1.1 :Interest of territory, cares of state,-- : None
1.1 :Which of you shall we say doth love us most? : None
1.1 :That we our largest bounty may extend : None
1.1 :Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril, : None
1.1 :Our eldest-born, speak first. : None
GONERIL
1.1 :Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter; : None
1.1 :Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty; : None
1.1 :Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare; : None
1.1 :No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour; : None
1.1 :As much as child e'er loved, or father found; : None
1.1 :A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable; : None
1.1 :Beyond all manner of so much I love you. : None
CORDELIA
1.1 :  What shall Cordelia do? : Aside : ['Aside - []'] : CORDELIA
1.1 :Love, and be silent. : None

1.1 :Of all these bounds, even from this line to this, : None
1.1 :With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd, : None
1.1 :With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads, : None
1.1 :We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue : None
1.1 :Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter, : None
1.1 :Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak. : None
REGAN
1.1 :Sir, I am made : None
1.1 :Of the self-same metal that my sister is, : None
1.1 :And prize me at her worth. In my true heart : None
1.1 :I find she names my very deed of love; : None
1.1 :Only she comes too short: that I profess : None
1.1 :Myself an enemy to all other joys, : None
1.1 :Which the most precious square of sense possesses; : None
1.1 :And find I am alone felicitate : None
1.1 :In your dear highness' love. : None
CORDELIA
1.1 :	Then poor Cordelia! : Aside : ['Aside - []'] : CORDELIA
1.1 :And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's : None
1.1 :More richer than my tongue. : None
KING LEAR
1.1 :To thee and thine hereditary ever : None
1.1 :Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom; : None
1.1 :No less in space, validity, and pleasure, : None
1.1 :Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy, : None
1.1 :Although the last, not least; to whose young love : None
1.1 :The vines of France and milk of Burgundy : None
1.1 :Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw : None
1.1 :A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak. : None
CORDELIA
1.1 :Nothing, my lord. : None
KING LEAR
1.1 :Nothing! : None
CORDELIA
1.1 :Nothing. : None
KING LEAR
1.1 :Nothing will come of nothing: speak again. : None
CORDELIA
1.1 :Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave : None
1.1 :My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty : None
1.1 :According to my bond; nor more nor less. : None
KING LEAR
1.1 :How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little, : None
1.1 :Lest it may mar your fortunes. : None
CORDELIA
1.1 :Good my lord, : None
1.1 :You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I : None
1.1 :Return those duties back as are right fit, : None
1.1 :Obey you, love you, and most honour you. : None
1.1 :Why have my sisters husbands, if they say : None
1.1 :They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed, : None
1.1 :That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry : None
1.1 :Half my love with him, half my care and duty: : None
1.1 :Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters, : None
1.1 :To love my father all. : None
KING LEAR
1.1 :But goes thy heart with this? : None
CORDELIA
1.1 :Ay, good my lord. : None
KING LEAR
1.1 :So young, and so untender? : None
CORDELIA
1.1 :So young, my lord, and true. : None
KING LEAR
1.1 :Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower: : None
1.1 :For, by the sacred radiance of the sun, : None
1.1 :The mysteries of Hecate, and the night; : None
1.1 :By all the operation of the orbs : None
1.1 :From whom we do exist, and cease to be; : None
1.1 :Here I disclaim all my paternal care, : None
1.1 :Propinquity and property of blood, : None
1.1 :And as a stranger to my heart and me : None
1.1 :Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian, : None
1.1 :Or he that makes his generation messes : None
1.1 :To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom : None
1.1 :Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved, : None
1.1 :As thou my sometime daughter. : None
KENT
1.1 :Good my liege,-- : None
KING LEAR
1.1 :Peace, Kent! : None
1.1 :Come not between the dragon and his wrath. : None
1.1 :I loved her most, and thought to set my rest : None
1.1 :On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight! : None
1.1 :So be my grave my peace, as here I give : None
1.1 :Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs? : None
1.1 :Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany, : None
1.1 :With my two daughters' dowers digest this third: : None
1.1 :Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her. : None
1.1 :I do invest you jointly with my power, : None
1.1 :Pre-eminence, and all the large effects : None
1.1 :That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course, : None
1.1 :With reservation of an hundred knights, : None
1.1 :By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode : None
1.1 :Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain : None
1.1 :The name, and all the additions to a king; : None
1.1 :The sway, revenue, execution of the rest, : None
1.1 :Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm, : None
1.1 :This coronet part betwixt you. : None
Giving the crown : ['None - []'] : KING LEAR
KENT
1.1 :Royal Lear, : None
1.1 :Whom I have ever honour'd as my king, : None
1.1 :Loved as my father, as my master follow'd, : None
1.1 :As my great patron thought on in my prayers,-- : None
KING LEAR
1.1 :The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft. : None
KENT
1.1 :Let it fall rather, though the fork invade : None
1.1 :The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly, : None
1.1 :When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man? : None
1.1 :Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak, : None
1.1 :When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound, : None
1.1 :When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom; : None
1.1 :And, in thy best consideration, cheque : None
1.1 :This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment, : None
1.1 :Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least; : None
1.1 :Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound : None

KING LEAR
1.1 :Kent, on thy life, no more. : None

1.1 :Thy safety being the motive. : None
KING LEAR

KENT

1.1 :The true blank of thine eye. : None
KING LEAR

Laying his hand on his sword : ['None - []'] : KING LEAR
ALBANY
CORNWALL
1.1 :Dear sir, forbear. : None
KENT
1.1 :Do: : None
1.1 :Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow : None
1.1 :Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom; : None
1.1 :Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat, : None
1.1 :I'll tell thee thou dost evil. : None
KING LEAR
1.1 :Hear me, recreant! : None
1.1 :On thine allegiance, hear me! : None
1.1 :Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow, : None
1.1 :Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride : None
1.1 :To come between our sentence and our power, : None
1.1 :Which nor our nature nor our place can bear, : None
1.1 :Our potency made good, take thy reward. : None
1.1 :Five days we do allot thee, for provision : None
1.1 :To shield thee from diseases of the world; : None

1.1 :Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following, : None
1.1 :Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions, : None

KENT
1.1 :Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear, : None
1.1 :Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here. : None

GLOUCESTER
1.1 :Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord. : None
KING LEAR
1.1 :My lord of Burgundy. : None
1.1 :We first address towards you, who with this king : None
1.1 :Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least, : None
1.1 :Will you require in present dower with her, : None
1.1 :Or cease your quest of love? : None
BURGUNDY
1.1 :Most royal majesty, : None
1.1 :I crave no more than what your highness offer'd, : None
1.1 :Nor will you tender less. : None
KING LEAR
1.1 :Right noble Burgundy, : None
1.1 :When she was dear to us, we did hold her so; : None
1.1 :But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands: : None
1.1 :If aught within that little seeming substance, : None
1.1 :Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced, : None
1.1 :And nothing more, may fitly like your grace, : None
1.1 :She's there, and she is yours. : None
BURGUNDY
1.1 :I know no answer. : None
KING LEAR
1.1 :Will you, with those infirmities she owes, : None
1.1 :Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate, : None
1.1 :Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath, : None
1.1 :Take her, or leave her? : None
BURGUNDY
1.1 :Pardon me, royal sir; : None
1.1 :Election makes not up on such conditions. : None
KING LEAR
1.1 :Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me, : None
1.1 :I tell you all her wealth. : None
To KING OF FRANCE : ["To - ['KING OF FRANCE']"] : KING LEAR
1.1 :For you, great king, : None
1.1 :I would not from your love make such a stray, : None
1.1 :To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you : None
1.1 :To avert your liking a more worthier way : None
1.1 :Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed : None
1.1 :Almost to acknowledge hers. : None
KING OF FRANCE
1.1 :This is most strange, : None
1.1 :That she, that even but now was your best object, : None
1.1 :The argument of your praise, balm of your age, : None
1.1 :Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time : None
1.1 :Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle : None
1.1 :So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence : None
1.1 :Must be of such unnatural degree, : None
1.1 :That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection : None
1.1 :Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her, : None
1.1 :Must be a faith that reason without miracle : None
1.1 :Could never plant in me. : None
CORDELIA
1.1 :I yet beseech your majesty,-- : None
1.1 :If for I want that glib and oily art, : None
1.1 :To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend, : None
1.1 :I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known : None
1.1 :It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness, : None
1.1 :No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step, : None
1.1 :That hath deprived me of your grace and favour; : None
1.1 :But even for want of that for which I am richer, : None
1.1 :A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue : None
1.1 :As I am glad I have not, though not to have it : None
1.1 :Hath lost me in your liking. : None
KING LEAR
1.1 :Better thou : None
1.1 :Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better. : None
KING OF FRANCE
1.1 :Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature : None
1.1 :Which often leaves the history unspoke : None
1.1 :That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy, : None
1.1 :What say you to the lady? Love's not love : None
1.1 :When it is mingled with regards that stand : None
1.1 :Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her? : None
1.1 :She is herself a dowry. : None
BURGUNDY
1.1 :Royal Lear, : None
1.1 :Give but that portion which yourself proposed, : None
1.1 :And here I take Cordelia by the hand, : None
1.1 :Duchess of Burgundy. : None
KING LEAR
1.1 :Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm. : None
BURGUNDY
1.1 :I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father : None
1.1 :That you must lose a husband. : None
CORDELIA
1.1 :Peace be with Burgundy! : None
1.1 :Since that respects of fortune are his love, : None
1.1 :I shall not be his wife. : None
KING OF FRANCE
1.1 :Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor; : None
1.1 :Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised! : None
1.1 :Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon: : None
1.1 :Be it lawful I take up what's cast away. : None
1.1 :Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect : None
1.1 :My love should kindle to inflamed respect. : None
1.1 :Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance, : None
1.1 :Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France: : None
1.1 :Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy : None
1.1 :Can buy this unprized precious maid of me. : None
1.1 :Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind: : None
1.1 :Thou losest here, a better where to find. : None
KING LEAR
1.1 :Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we : None
1.1 :Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see : None
1.1 :That face of hers again. Therefore be gone : None
1.1 :Without our grace, our love, our benison. : None
1.1 :Come, noble Burgundy. : None

CORDELIA
1.1 :The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes : None
1.1 :Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are; : None
1.1 :And like a sister am most loath to call : None
1.1 :Your faults as they are named. Use well our father: : None
1.1 :To your professed bosoms I commit him : None
1.1 :But yet, alas, stood I within his grace, : None
1.1 :I would prefer him to a better place. : None
1.1 :So, farewell to you both. : None
REGAN
1.1 :Prescribe not us our duties. : None
GONERIL
1.1 :Let your study : None
1.1 :Be to content your lord, who hath received you : None
1.1 :At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted, : None
1.1 :And well are worth the want that you have wanted. : None
CORDELIA
1.1 :Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides: : None
1.1 :Who cover faults, at last shame them derides. : None
1.1 :Well may you prosper! : None
KING OF FRANCE
1.1 :Come, my fair Cordelia. : None
Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA : ["Exeunt - ['KING OF FRANCE', 'CORDELIA']"] : KING OF FRANCE
GONERIL
1.1 :Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what : None
1.1 :most nearly appertains to us both. I think our : None
1.1 :father will hence to-night. : None
REGAN
1.1 :That's most certain, and with you; next month with us. : None
GONERIL
1.1 :You see how full of changes his age is; the : None
1.1 :observation we have made of it hath not been : None
1.1 :little: he always loved our sister most; and : None
1.1 :with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off : None
1.1 :appears too grossly. : None
REGAN
1.1 :'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever : None
1.1 :but slenderly known himself. : None
GONERIL
1.1 :The best and soundest of his time hath been but : None
1.1 :rash; then must we look to receive from his age, : None
1.1 :not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed : None
1.1 :condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness : None
1.1 :that infirm and choleric years bring with them. : None
REGAN
1.1 :Such unconstant starts are we like to have from : None
1.1 :him as this of Kent's banishment. : None
GONERIL
1.1 :There is further compliment of leavetaking : None
1.1 :between France and him. Pray you, let's hit : None
1.1 :together: if our father carry authority with : None
1.1 :such dispositions as he bears, this last : None
1.1 :surrender of his will but offend us. : None
REGAN
1.1 :We shall further think on't. : None
GONERIL
1.1 :We must do something, and i' the heat. : None

Enter EDMUND, with a letter : ["Enter - ['EDMUND']"] : GONERIL
EDMUND
1.2 :Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law : None
1.2 :My services are bound. Wherefore should I : None
1.2 :Stand in the plague of custom, and permit : None
1.2 :The curiosity of nations to deprive me, : None
1.2 :For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines : None
1.2 :Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base? : None
1.2 :When my dimensions are as well compact, : None
1.2 :My mind as generous, and my shape as true, : None
1.2 :As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us : None
1.2 :With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base? : None

GLOUCESTER
1.2 :What paper were you reading? : None
EDMUND
1.2 :Nothing, my lord. : None
GLOUCESTER
1.2 :No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of : None
1.2 :it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath : None
1.2 :not such need to hide itself. Let's see: come, : None
1.2 :if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles. : None
EDMUND
1.2 :I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter : None
1.2 :from my brother, that I have not all o'er-read; : None
1.2 :and for so much as I have perused, I find it not : None
1.2 :fit for your o'er-looking. : None
GLOUCESTER
1.2 :Give me the letter, sir. : None
EDMUND
1.2 :I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The : None

GLOUCESTER
1.2 :Let's see, let's see. : None
EDMUND
1.2 :I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote : None

GLOUCESTER

1.2 :you to suspend your indignation against my : None

1.2 :testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain : None

1.2 :These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend : None
1.2 :no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can : None
