1.1 :Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall : None
1.1 :And by the doom of death end woes and all. : None
DUKE SOLINUS
1.1 :Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more; : None
1.1 :I am not partial to infringe our laws: : None
1.1 :The enmity and discord which of late : None
1.1 :Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke : None
1.1 :To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen, : None
1.1 :Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives : None
1.1 :Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods, : None
1.1 :Excludes all pity from our threatening looks. : None
1.1 :For, since the mortal and intestine jars : None

1.1 :It hath in solemn synods been decreed : None
1.1 :Both by the Syracusians and ourselves, : None
1.1 :To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more, : None
1.1 :If any born at Ephesus be seen : None
1.1 :At any Syracusian marts and fairs; : None
1.1 :Again: if any Syracusian born : None
1.1 :Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies, : None
1.1 :His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose, : None
1.1 :Unless a thousand marks be levied, : None
1.1 :To quit the penalty and to ransom him. : None
1.1 :Thy substance, valued at the highest rate, : None
1.1 :Cannot amount unto a hundred marks; : None
1.1 :Therefore by law thou art condemned to die. : None
AEGEON
1.1 :Yet this my comfort: when your words are done, : None
1.1 :My woes end likewise with the evening sun. : None
DUKE SOLINUS
1.1 :Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause : None
1.1 :Why thou departed'st from thy native home : None
1.1 :And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus. : None
AEGEON
1.1 :A heavier task could not have been imposed : None
1.1 :Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable: : None
1.1 :Yet, that the world may witness that my end : None
1.1 :Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence, : None
1.1 :I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave. : None
1.1 :In Syracusa was I born, and wed : None
1.1 :Unto a woman, happy but for me, : None
1.1 :And by me, had not our hap been bad. : None
1.1 :With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased : None
1.1 :By prosperous voyages I often made : None
1.1 :To Epidamnum; till my factor's death : None
1.1 :And the great care of goods at random left : None
1.1 :Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse: : None
1.1 :From whom my absence was not six months old : None
1.1 :Before herself, almost at fainting under : None
1.1 :The pleasing punishment that women bear, : None
1.1 :Had made provision for her following me : None
1.1 :And soon and safe arrived where I was. : None
1.1 :There had she not been long, but she became : None
1.1 :A joyful mother of two goodly sons; : None
1.1 :And, which was strange, the one so like the other, : None
1.1 :As could not be distinguish'd but by names. : None
1.1 :That very hour, and in the self-same inn, : None
1.1 :A meaner woman was delivered : None
1.1 :Of such a burden, male twins, both alike: : None
1.1 :Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,-- : None
1.1 :I bought and brought up to attend my sons. : None
1.1 :My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys, : None
1.1 :Made daily motions for our home return: : None
1.1 :Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon, : None
1.1 :We came aboard. : None
1.1 :A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd, : None
1.1 :Before the always wind-obeying deep : None
1.1 :Gave any tragic instance of our harm: : None
1.1 :But longer did we not retain much hope; : None
1.1 :For what obscured light the heavens did grant : None
1.1 :Did but convey unto our fearful minds : None
1.1 :A doubtful warrant of immediate death; : None
1.1 :Which though myself would gladly have embraced, : None
1.1 :Yet the incessant weepings of my wife, : None
1.1 :Weeping before for what she saw must come, : None
1.1 :And piteous plainings of the pretty babes, : None
1.1 :That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear, : None
1.1 :Forced me to seek delays for them and me. : None
1.1 :And this it was, for other means was none: : None
1.1 :The sailors sought for safety by our boat, : None
1.1 :And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us: : None
1.1 :My wife, more careful for the latter-born, : None
1.1 :Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast, : None
1.1 :Such as seafaring men provide for storms; : None
1.1 :To him one of the other twins was bound, : None
1.1 :Whilst I had been like heedful of the other: : None
1.1 :The children thus disposed, my wife and I, : None
1.1 :Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd, : None
1.1 :Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast; : None
1.1 :And floating straight, obedient to the stream, : None
1.1 :Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought. : None
1.1 :At length the sun, gazing upon the earth, : None
1.1 :Dispersed those vapours that offended us; : None
1.1 :And by the benefit of his wished light, : None
1.1 :The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered : None
1.1 :Two ships from far making amain to us, : None
1.1 :Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this: : None
1.1 :But ere they came,--O, let me say no more! : None
1.1 :Gather the sequel by that went before. : None
DUKE SOLINUS
1.1 :Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so; : None
1.1 :For we may pity, though not pardon thee. : None
AEGEON
1.1 :O, had the gods done so, I had not now : None
1.1 :Worthily term'd them merciless to us! : None
1.1 :For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues, : None
1.1 :We were encounterd by a mighty rock; : None
1.1 :Which being violently borne upon, : None
1.1 :Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst; : None
1.1 :So that, in this unjust divorce of us, : None
1.1 :Fortune had left to both of us alike : None
1.1 :What to delight in, what to sorrow for. : None
1.1 :Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened : None
1.1 :With lesser weight but not with lesser woe, : None
1.1 :Was carried with more speed before the wind; : None
1.1 :And in our sight they three were taken up : None
1.1 :By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought. : None
1.1 :At length, another ship had seized on us; : None
1.1 :And, knowing whom it was their hap to save, : None
1.1 :Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests; : None
1.1 :And would have reft the fishers of their prey, : None
1.1 :Had not their bark been very slow of sail; : None
1.1 :And therefore homeward did they bend their course. : None
1.1 :Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss; : None
1.1 :That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd, : None
1.1 :To tell sad stories of my own mishaps. : None
DUKE SOLINUS
1.1 :And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for, : None
1.1 :Do me the favour to dilate at full : None
1.1 :What hath befall'n of them and thee till now. : None
AEGEON
1.1 :My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care, : None
1.1 :At eighteen years became inquisitive : None
1.1 :After his brother: and importuned me : None
1.1 :That his attendant--so his case was like, : None
1.1 :Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name-- : None
1.1 :Might bear him company in the quest of him: : None
1.1 :Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see, : None
1.1 :I hazarded the loss of whom I loved. : None
1.1 :Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece, : None
1.1 :Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia, : None
1.1 :And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus; : None
1.1 :Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought : None
1.1 :Or that or any place that harbours men. : None
1.1 :But here must end the story of my life; : None
1.1 :And happy were I in my timely death, : None
1.1 :Could all my travels warrant me they live. : None
DUKE SOLINUS
1.1 :Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd : None
1.1 :To bear the extremity of dire mishap! : None
1.1 :Now, trust me, were it not against our laws, : None
1.1 :Against my crown, my oath, my dignity, : None
1.1 :Which princes, would they, may not disannul, : None
1.1 :My soul would sue as advocate for thee. : None
1.1 :But, though thou art adjudged to the death : None
1.1 :And passed sentence may not be recall'd : None
1.1 :But to our honour's great disparagement, : None
1.1 :Yet I will favour thee in what I can. : None
1.1 :Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day : None
1.1 :To seek thy life by beneficial help: : None
1.1 :Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus; : None
1.1 :Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum, : None
1.1 :And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die. : None
1.1 :Gaoler, take him to thy custody. : None
GAOLER
1.1 :I will, my lord. : None
AEGEON
1.1 :Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend, : None
1.1 :But to procrastinate his lifeless end. : None
