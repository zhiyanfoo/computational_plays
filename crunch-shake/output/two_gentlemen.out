1.1 :To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love, : None
1.1 :I rather would entreat thy company : None
1.1 :To see the wonders of the world abroad, : None
1.1 :Than, living dully sluggardized at home, : None
1.1 :Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness. : None
1.1 :But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein, : None
1.1 :Even as I would when I to love begin. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu! : None
1.1 :Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest : None
1.1 :Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel: : None

VALENTINE
1.1 :And on a love-book pray for my success? : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee. : None
VALENTINE
1.1 :That's on some shallow story of deep love: : None
1.1 :How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :That's a deep story of a deeper love: : None
1.1 :For he was more than over shoes in love. : None
VALENTINE
1.1 :'Tis true; for you are over boots in love, : None
1.1 :And yet you never swum the Hellespont. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots. : None
VALENTINE
1.1 :No, I will not, for it boots thee not. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :What? : None
VALENTINE
1.1 :To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans; : None
1.1 :Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth : None
1.1 :With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights: : None
1.1 :If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain; : None
1.1 :If lost, why then a grievous labour won; : None
1.1 :However, but a folly bought with wit, : None
1.1 :Or else a wit by folly vanquished. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :So, by your circumstance, you call me fool. : None
VALENTINE
1.1 :So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love. : None
VALENTINE
1.1 :Love is your master, for he masters you: : None
1.1 :And he that is so yoked by a fool, : None
1.1 :Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud : None
1.1 :The eating canker dwells, so eating love : None
1.1 :Inhabits in the finest wits of all. : None
VALENTINE
1.1 :And writers say, as the most forward bud : None
1.1 :Is eaten by the canker ere it blow, : None
1.1 :Even so by love the young and tender wit : None
1.1 :Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud, : None
1.1 :Losing his verdure even in the prime : None
1.1 :And all the fair effects of future hopes. : None
1.1 :But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee, : None
1.1 :That art a votary to fond desire? : None

1.1 :I leave myself, my friends and all, for love. : None
1.1 :Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me, : None

Enter SPEED : ["Enter - ['SPEED']"] : PROTEUS
SPEED
1.1 :Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master? : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan. : None
SPEED
1.1 :Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already, : None
1.1 :And I have play'd the sheep in losing him. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray, : None
1.1 :An if the shepherd be a while away. : None
SPEED
1.1 :You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then, : None
1.1 :and I a sheep? : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :I do. : None
SPEED
1.1 :Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :A silly answer and fitting well a sheep. : None
SPEED
1.1 :This proves me still a sheep. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :True; and thy master a shepherd. : None
SPEED
1.1 :Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another. : None
SPEED
1.1 :The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the : None
1.1 :shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks : None
1.1 :not me: therefore I am no sheep. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the : None
1.1 :shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for : None
1.1 :wages followest thy master; thy master for wages : None
1.1 :follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep. : None
SPEED
1.1 :Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.' : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia? : None
SPEED
1.1 :Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her, : None
1.1 :a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a : None
1.1 :lost mutton, nothing for my labour. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons. : None
SPEED
1.1 :If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you. : None
SPEED
1.1 :Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for : None
1.1 :carrying your letter. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :You mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold. : None
SPEED
1.1 :From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over, : None
1.1 :'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to : None
1.1 :your lover. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :But what said she? : None
SPEED
1.1 :  Ay. : First nodding : ['None - []'] : SPEED
PROTEUS
1.1 :Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy. : None
SPEED
1.1 :You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you ask : None
1.1 :me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.' : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :And that set together is noddy. : None
SPEED
1.1 :Now you have taken the pains to set it together, : None
1.1 :take it for your pains. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter. : None
SPEED
1.1 :Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :Why sir, how do you bear with me? : None
SPEED
1.1 :Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing : None
1.1 :but the word 'noddy' for my pains. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit. : None
SPEED
1.1 :And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she? : None
SPEED
1.1 :Open your purse, that the money and the matter may : None
1.1 :be both at once delivered. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she? : None
SPEED
1.1 :Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her? : None
SPEED
1.1 :Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no, : None
1.1 :not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter: : None
1.1 :and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I : None
1.1 :fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your : None
1.1 :mind. Give her no token but stones; for she's as : None
1.1 :hard as steel. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :What said she? nothing? : None
SPEED
1.1 :No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To : None
1.1 :testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned : None
1.1 :me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your : None
1.1 :letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master. : None
PROTEUS
1.1 :Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck, : None

JULIA
1.2 :What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour? : None

JULIA
1.2 :What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio? : None

JULIA
1.2 :Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest? : None
LUCETTA
1.2 :Then thus: of many good I think him best. : None
JULIA
1.2 :Your reason? : None
LUCETTA
1.2 :I have no other, but a woman's reason; : None
1.2 :I think him so because I think him so. : None
JULIA
1.2 :And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him? : None
LUCETTA
1.2 :Ay, if you thought your love not cast away. : None
JULIA
1.2 :Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me. : None
LUCETTA

1.2 :What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid, : None
1.2 :And would not force the letter to my view! : None
1.2 :Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that : None
1.2 :Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.' : None
1.2 :Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love : None

JULIA
1.2 :You, minion, are too saucy. : None
LUCETTA
1.2 :Nay, now you are too flat : None

SPEED
2.1 :Marry, by these special marks: first, you have : None
2.1 :learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms, : None
2.1 :like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a : None
2.1 :robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had : None
2.1 :the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had : None
2.1 :lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had : None
2.1 :buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes : None
2.1 :diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to : None
2.1 :speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were : None
2.1 :wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you : None

2.1 :ungartered! : None
VALENTINE
2.1 :What should I see then? : None
SPEED
2.1 :Your own present folly and her passing deformity: : None

VALENTINE

2.4 :Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me : None
2.4 :With bitter fasts, with penitential groans, : None
2.4 :With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs; : None
2.4 :For in revenge of my contempt of love, : None
