4.2 :Finding thee fit for bloody villany, : None
4.2 :Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger, : None
4.2 :I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death; : None

4.2 :As bid me tell my tale in express words, : None
4.2 :Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off, : None
4.2 :And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me: : None
4.2 :But thou didst understand me by my signs : None
4.2 :And didst in signs again parley with sin; : None
4.2 :Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent, : None

4.2 :The dreadful motion of a murderous thought; : None
4.2 :And you have slander'd nature in my form, : None
4.2 :Which, howsoever rude exteriorly, : None

4.2 :Than to be butcher of an innocent child. : None
KING JOHN
4.2 :Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers, : None
4.2 :Throw this report on their incensed rage, : None
4.2 :And make them tame to their obedience! : None
4.2 :Forgive the comment that my passion made : None
4.2 :Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind, : None
4.2 :And foul imaginary eyes of blood : None
4.2 :Presented thee more hideous than thou art. : None
