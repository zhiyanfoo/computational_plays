ESCALUS
1.1 :My lord. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
1.1 :Of government the properties to unfold, : None
1.1 :Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse; : None
1.1 :Since I am put to know that your own science : None
1.1 :Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice : None
1.1 :My strength can give you: then no more remains, : None
1.1 :But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able, : None
1.1 :And let them work. The nature of our people, : None
1.1 :Our city's institutions, and the terms : None
1.1 :For common justice, you're as pregnant in : None
1.1 :As art and practise hath enriched any : None
1.1 :That we remember. There is our commission, : None

DUKE VINCENTIO
1.1 :Angelo, : None
1.1 :There is a kind of character in thy life, : None

1.1 :Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee. : None
1.1 :Heaven doth with us as we with torches do, : None
1.1 :Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues : None
1.1 :Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike : None
1.1 :As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd : None
1.1 :But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends : None
1.1 :The smallest scruple of her excellence : None
1.1 :But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines : None
1.1 :Herself the glory of a creditor, : None
1.1 :Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech : None
1.1 :To one that can my part in him advertise; : None
1.1 :Hold therefore, Angelo:-- : None
1.1 :In our remove be thou at full ourself; : None
1.1 :Mortality and mercy in Vienna : None

1.1 :Now, good my lord, : None
1.1 :Let there be some more test made of my metal, : None

DUKE VINCENTIO
1.1 :No more evasion: : None
1.1 :We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice : None

1.1 :Our haste from hence is of so quick condition : None
1.1 :That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd : None

1.1 :As time and our concernings shall importune, : None

ANGELO
1.1 :Yet give leave, my lord, : None
1.1 :That we may bring you something on the way. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
1.1 :My haste may not admit it; : None
1.1 :Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do : None
1.1 :With any scruple; your scope is as mine own : None
1.1 :So to enforce or qualify the laws : None
1.1 :As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand: : None
1.1 :I'll privily away. I love the people, : None
1.1 :But do not like to stage me to their eyes: : None
1.1 :Through it do well, I do not relish well : None
1.1 :Their loud applause and Aves vehement; : None
1.1 :Nor do I think the man of safe discretion : None

1.1 :I am not yet instructed. : None
ANGELO
1.1 :'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together, : None

FIRST GENTLEMAN
1.2 :Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of : None
1.2 :Hungary's! : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN
1.2 :Amen. : None
LUCIO
1.2 :Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that : None

SECOND GENTLEMAN
1.2 :'Thou shalt not steal'? : None
LUCIO
1.2 :Ay, that he razed. : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
1.2 :Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and : None
1.2 :all the rest from their functions: they put forth : None
1.2 :to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in : None
1.2 :the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition : None
1.2 :well that prays for peace. : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN
1.2 :I never heard any soldier dislike it. : None
LUCIO
1.2 :I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where : None
1.2 :grace was said. : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN
1.2 :No? a dozen times at least. : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
1.2 :What, in metre? : None
LUCIO
1.2 :In any proportion or in any language. : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
1.2 :I think, or in any religion. : None
LUCIO
1.2 :Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all : None
1.2 :controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a : None
1.2 :wicked villain, despite of all grace. : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
1.2 :Well, there went but a pair of shears between us. : None
LUCIO
1.2 :I grant; as there may between the lists and the : None
1.2 :velvet. Thou art the list. : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
1.2 :And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt : None
1.2 :a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief : None
1.2 :be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou : None
1.2 :art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak : None
1.2 :feelingly now? : None
LUCIO
1.2 :I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful : None
1.2 :feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own : None
1.2 :confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I : None
1.2 :live, forget to drink after thee. : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
1.2 :I think I have done myself wrong, have I not? : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN
1.2 :Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free. : None
LUCIO
1.2 :Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I : None

SECOND GENTLEMAN
1.2 :To what, I pray? : None

1.2 :Judge. : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN

FIRST GENTLEMAN
1.2 :Ay, and more. : None

FIRST GENTLEMAN
1.2 :Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou : None
1.2 :art full of error; I am sound. : None
LUCIO
1.2 :Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as : None
1.2 :things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow; : None
1.2 :impiety has made a feast of thee. : None

SECOND GENTLEMAN
1.2 :Who's that, I pray thee? : None
MISTRESS OVERDONE
1.2 :Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio. : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
1.2 :Claudio to prison? 'tis not so. : None
MISTRESS OVERDONE
1.2 :Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw : None
1.2 :him carried away; and, which is more, within these : None
1.2 :three days his head to be chopped off. : None
LUCIO
1.2 :But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so. : None
1.2 :Art thou sure of this? : None
MISTRESS OVERDONE
1.2 :I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam : None
1.2 :Julietta with child. : None
LUCIO
1.2 :Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two : None
1.2 :hours since, and he was ever precise in : None
1.2 :promise-keeping. : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN
1.2 :Besides, you know, it draws something near to the : None
1.2 :speech we had to such a purpose. : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN

LUCIO
1.2 :Away! let's go learn the truth of it. : None

POMPEY
1.2 :A woman. : None
MISTRESS OVERDONE
1.2 :But what's his offence? : None
POMPEY
1.2 :Groping for trouts in a peculiar river. : None
MISTRESS OVERDONE
1.2 :What, is there a maid with child by him? : None
POMPEY

MISTRESS OVERDONE
1.2 :What proclamation, man? : None
POMPEY
1.2 :All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down. : None
MISTRESS OVERDONE
1.2 :And what shall become of those in the city? : None
POMPEY
1.2 :They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too, : None
1.2 :but that a wise burgher put in for them. : None
MISTRESS OVERDONE
1.2 :But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be : None
1.2 :pulled down? : None
POMPEY
1.2 :To the ground, mistress. : None
MISTRESS OVERDONE
1.2 :Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth! : None
1.2 :What shall become of me? : None
POMPEY
1.2 :Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no : None
1.2 :clients: though you change your place, you need not : None
1.2 :change your trade; I'll be your tapster still. : None
1.2 :Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that : None
1.2 :have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you : None
1.2 :will be considered. : None

PROVOST
1.2 :I do it not in evil disposition, : None
1.2 :But from Lord Angelo by special charge. : None

1.2 :Make us pay down for our offence by weight : None

1.2 :On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just. : None
Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen : ["Re-enter - ['LUCIO']"] : CLAUDIO
LUCIO
1.2 :Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint? : None
CLAUDIO
1.2 :From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty: : None
1.2 :As surfeit is the father of much fast, : None
1.2 :So every scope by the immoderate use : None
1.2 :Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue, : None
1.2 :Like rats that ravin down their proper bane, : None
1.2 :A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die. : None
LUCIO
1.2 :If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would : None
1.2 :send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say : None
1.2 :the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom : None
1.2 :as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy : None
1.2 :offence, Claudio? : None
CLAUDIO
1.2 :What but to speak of would offend again. : None
LUCIO
1.2 :What, is't murder? : None
CLAUDIO
1.2 :No. : None

CLAUDIO

PROVOST
1.2 :Away, sir! you must go. : None
CLAUDIO
1.2 :One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you. : None
LUCIO
1.2 :A hundred, if they'll do you any good. : None
1.2 :Is lechery so look'd after? : None
CLAUDIO
1.2 :Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract : None
1.2 :I got possession of Julietta's bed: : None
1.2 :You know the lady; she is fast my wife, : None
1.2 :Save that we do the denunciation lack : None
1.2 :Of outward order: this we came not to, : None
1.2 :Only for propagation of a dower : None
1.2 :Remaining in the coffer of her friends, : None
1.2 :From whom we thought it meet to hide our love : None
1.2 :Till time had made them for us. But it chances : None
1.2 :The stealth of our most mutual entertainment : None
1.2 :With character too gross is writ on Juliet. : None
LUCIO
1.2 :With child, perhaps? : None
CLAUDIO
1.2 :Unhappily, even so. : None
1.2 :And the new deputy now for the duke-- : None
1.2 :Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness, : None
1.2 :Or whether that the body public be : None
1.2 :A horse whereon the governor doth ride, : None
1.2 :Who, newly in the seat, that it may know : None
1.2 :He can command, lets it straight feel the spur; : None
1.2 :Whether the tyranny be in his place, : None
1.2 :Or in his emmence that fills it up, : None
1.2 :I stagger in:--but this new governor : None
1.2 :Awakes me all the enrolled penalties : None
1.2 :Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall : None
1.2 :So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round : None
1.2 :And none of them been worn; and, for a name, : None
1.2 :Now puts the drowsy and neglected act : None
1.2 :Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name. : None
LUCIO
1.2 :I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on : None
1.2 :thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love, : None
1.2 :may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to : None
1.2 :him. : None
CLAUDIO
1.2 :I have done so, but he's not to be found. : None
1.2 :I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service: : None
1.2 :This day my sister should the cloister enter : None
1.2 :And there receive her approbation: : None
1.2 :Acquaint her with the danger of my state: : None
1.2 :Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends : None
1.2 :To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him: : None
1.2 :I have great hope in that; for in her youth : None
1.2 :There is a prone and speechless dialect, : None
1.2 :Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art : None
1.2 :When she will play with reason and discourse, : None
1.2 :And well she can persuade. : None
LUCIO
1.2 :I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the : None
1.2 :like, which else would stand under grievous : None
1.2 :imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I : None
1.2 :would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a : None
1.2 :game of tick-tack. I'll to her. : None
CLAUDIO
1.2 :I thank you, good friend Lucio. : None
LUCIO
1.2 :Within two hours. : None
CLAUDIO
1.2 :                  Come, officer, away! : None

Enter DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMAS : ["Enter - ['DUKE', 'FRIAR THOMAS']"] : CLAUDIO
DUKE VINCENTIO
1.3 :No, holy father; throw away that thought; : None
1.3 :Believe not that the dribbling dart of love : None
1.3 :Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee : None
1.3 :To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose : None
1.3 :More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends : None
1.3 :Of burning youth. : None
FRIAR THOMAS
1.3 :                  May your grace speak of it? : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
1.3 :My holy sir, none better knows than you : None
1.3 :How I have ever loved the life removed : None
1.3 :And held in idle price to haunt assemblies : None
1.3 :Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps. : None
1.3 :I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo, : None
1.3 :A man of stricture and firm abstinence, : None
1.3 :My absolute power and place here in Vienna, : None
1.3 :And he supposes me travell'd to Poland; : None
1.3 :For so I have strew'd it in the common ear, : None
1.3 :And so it is received. Now, pious sir, : None
1.3 :You will demand of me why I do this? : None
FRIAR THOMAS
1.3 :Gladly, my lord. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
1.3 :We have strict statutes and most biting laws. : None
1.3 :The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds, : None
1.3 :Which for this nineteen years we have let slip; : None
1.3 :Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave, : None
1.3 :That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers, : None
1.3 :Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch, : None
1.3 :Only to stick it in their children's sight : None
1.3 :For terror, not to use, in time the rod : None
1.3 :Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees, : None
1.3 :Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead; : None
1.3 :And liberty plucks justice by the nose; : None
1.3 :The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart : None
1.3 :Goes all decorum. : None
FRIAR THOMAS
1.3 :                  It rested in your grace : None
1.3 :To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased: : None
1.3 :And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd : None
1.3 :Than in Lord Angelo. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
1.3 :I do fear, too dreadful: : None
1.3 :Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope, : None
1.3 :'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them : None
1.3 :For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done, : None
1.3 :When evil deeds have their permissive pass : None
1.3 :And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father, : None
1.3 :I have on Angelo imposed the office; : None
1.3 :Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home, : None
1.3 :And yet my nature never in the fight : None
1.3 :To do in slander. And to behold his sway, : None
1.3 :I will, as 'twere a brother of your order, : None
1.3 :Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee, : None
1.3 :Supply me with the habit and instruct me : None
1.3 :How I may formally in person bear me : None
1.3 :Like a true friar. More reasons for this action : None
1.3 :At our more leisure shall I render you; : None
1.3 :Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise; : None
1.3 :Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses : None
1.3 :That his blood flows, or that his appetite : None
1.3 :Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see, : None
1.3 :If power change purpose, what our seemers be. : None

2.2 :If He, which is the top of judgment, should : None

2.2 :It is the law, not I condemn your brother: : None

ISABELLA

2.4 :Nay, women are frail too. : None

2.4 :My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life, : None
2.4 :My vouch against you, and my place i' the state, : None
2.4 :Will so your accusation overweigh, : None
2.4 :That you shall stifle in your own report : None
2.4 :And smell of calumny. I have begun, : None
2.4 :And now I give my sensual race the rein: : None
2.4 :Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite; : None
2.4 :Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes, : None
2.4 :That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother : None
2.4 :By yielding up thy body to my will; : None
2.4 :Or else he must not only die the death, : None
2.4 :But thy unkindness shall his death draw out : None
2.4 :To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow, : None
2.4 :Or, by the affection that now guides me most, : None
2.4 :I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you, : None

2.4 :To whom should I complain? Did I tell this, : None
2.4 :Who would believe me? O perilous mouths, : None
2.4 :That bear in them one and the self-same tongue, : None
2.4 :Either of condemnation or approof; : None
2.4 :Bidding the law make court'sy to their will: : None
2.4 :Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite, : None

DUKE VINCENTIO
3.1 :So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo? : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :The miserable have no other medicine : None
3.1 :But only hope: : None
3.1 :I've hope to live, and am prepared to die. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.1 :Be absolute for death; either death or life : None
3.1 :Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life: : None
3.1 :If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing : None
3.1 :That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art, : None
3.1 :Servile to all the skyey influences, : None
3.1 :That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st, : None
3.1 :Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool; : None
3.1 :For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun : None
3.1 :And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble; : None
3.1 :For all the accommodations that thou bear'st : None
3.1 :Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant; : None
3.1 :For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork : None
3.1 :Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep, : None
3.1 :And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st : None
3.1 :Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself; : None
3.1 :For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains : None
3.1 :That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not; : None
3.1 :For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get, : None
3.1 :And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain; : None
3.1 :For thy complexion shifts to strange effects, : None
3.1 :After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor; : None
3.1 :For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows, : None
3.1 :Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey, : None
3.1 :And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none; : None
3.1 :For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire, : None
3.1 :The mere effusion of thy proper loins, : None
3.1 :Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum, : None
3.1 :For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age, : None
3.1 :But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep, : None
3.1 :Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth : None
3.1 :Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms : None
3.1 :Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich, : None
3.1 :Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty, : None
3.1 :To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this : None
3.1 :That bears the name of life? Yet in this life : None
3.1 :Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear, : None
3.1 :That makes these odds all even. : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :I humbly thank you. : None
3.1 :To sue to live, I find I seek to die; : None

Enter ISABELLA : ["Enter - ['ISABELLA']"] : CLAUDIO
ISABELLA

PROVOST

DUKE VINCENTIO

PROVOST

Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost : ["Exeunt - ['DUKE', 'PROVOST']"] : DUKE VINCENTIO
CLAUDIO
3.1 :Now, sister, what's the comfort? : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :Why, : None
3.1 :As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed. : None
3.1 :Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven, : None
3.1 :Intends you for his swift ambassador, : None
3.1 :Where you shall be an everlasting leiger: : None
3.1 :Therefore your best appointment make with speed; : None
3.1 :To-morrow you set on. : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :Is there no remedy? : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :None, but such remedy as, to save a head, : None
3.1 :To cleave a heart in twain. : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :But is there any? : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :Yes, brother, you may live: : None
3.1 :There is a devilish mercy in the judge, : None
3.1 :If you'll implore it, that will free your life, : None
3.1 :But fetter you till death. : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :Perpetual durance? : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint, : None
3.1 :Though all the world's vastidity you had, : None
3.1 :To a determined scope. : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :But in what nature? : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :In such a one as, you consenting to't, : None
3.1 :Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear, : None
3.1 :And leave you naked. : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :Let me know the point. : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake, : None
3.1 :Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain, : None
3.1 :And six or seven winters more respect : None
3.1 :Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die? : None
3.1 :The sense of death is most in apprehension; : None
3.1 :And the poor beetle, that we tread upon, : None
3.1 :In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great : None
3.1 :As when a giant dies. : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :Why give you me this shame? : None
3.1 :Think you I can a resolution fetch : None
3.1 :From flowery tenderness? If I must die, : None
3.1 :I will encounter darkness as a bride, : None
3.1 :And hug it in mine arms. : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :There spake my brother; there my father's grave : None
3.1 :Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die: : None
3.1 :Thou art too noble to conserve a life : None
3.1 :In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy, : None
3.1 :Whose settled visage and deliberate word : None
3.1 :Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew : None
3.1 :As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil : None
3.1 :His filth within being cast, he would appear : None
3.1 :A pond as deep as hell. : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :The prenzie Angelo! : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell, : None
3.1 :The damned'st body to invest and cover : None
3.1 :In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio? : None
3.1 :If I would yield him my virginity, : None
3.1 :Thou mightst be freed. : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :O heavens! it cannot be. : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence, : None
3.1 :So to offend him still. This night's the time : None
3.1 :That I should do what I abhor to name, : None
3.1 :Or else thou diest to-morrow. : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :Thou shalt not do't. : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :O, were it but my life, : None
3.1 :I'ld throw it down for your deliverance : None
3.1 :As frankly as a pin. : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :Thanks, dear Isabel. : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow. : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :Yes. Has he affections in him, : None
3.1 :That thus can make him bite the law by the nose, : None
3.1 :When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin, : None
3.1 :Or of the deadly seven, it is the least. : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :Which is the least? : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :If it were damnable, he being so wise, : None
3.1 :Why would he for the momentary trick : None
3.1 :Be perdurably fined? O Isabel! : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :What says my brother? : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :Death is a fearful thing. : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :And shamed life a hateful. : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :Ay, but to die, and go we know not where; : None
3.1 :To lie in cold obstruction and to rot; : None
3.1 :This sensible warm motion to become : None
3.1 :A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit : None
3.1 :To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside : None
3.1 :In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice; : None
3.1 :To be imprison'd in the viewless winds, : None
3.1 :And blown with restless violence round about : None
3.1 :The pendent world; or to be worse than worst : None
3.1 :Of those that lawless and incertain thought : None
3.1 :Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible! : None
3.1 :The weariest and most loathed worldly life : None
3.1 :That age, ache, penury and imprisonment : None
3.1 :Can lay on nature is a paradise : None
3.1 :To what we fear of death. : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :Alas, alas! : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :          Sweet sister, let me live: : None
3.1 :What sin you do to save a brother's life, : None
3.1 :Nature dispenses with the deed so far : None
3.1 :That it becomes a virtue. : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :O you beast! : None
3.1 :O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch! : None
3.1 :Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice? : None
3.1 :Is't not a kind of incest, to take life : None
3.1 :From thine own sister's shame? What should I think? : None
3.1 :Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair! : None
3.1 :For such a warped slip of wilderness : None
3.1 :Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance! : None
3.1 :Die, perish! Might but my bending down : None
3.1 :Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed: : None
3.1 :I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death, : None
3.1 :No word to save thee. : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :Nay, hear me, Isabel. : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :O, fie, fie, fie! : None
3.1 :Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade. : None
3.1 :Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd: : None
3.1 :'Tis best thou diest quickly. : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :O hear me, Isabella! : None
Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIO : ["Re-enter - ['DUKE']"] : CLAUDIO
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.1 :Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word. : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :What is your will? : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.1 :Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and : None
3.1 :by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I : None
3.1 :would require is likewise your own benefit. : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be : None
3.1 :stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile. : None
Walks apart : ['None - []'] : ISABELLA
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.1 :Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you : None
3.1 :and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to : None
3.1 :corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her : None
3.1 :virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition : None
3.1 :of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her, : None
3.1 :hath made him that gracious denial which he is most : None
3.1 :glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I : None
3.1 :know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to : None
3.1 :death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes : None
3.1 :that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to : None
3.1 :your knees and make ready. : None
CLAUDIO
3.1 :Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love : None
3.1 :with life that I will sue to be rid of it. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.1 :Hold you there: farewell. : None
Exit CLAUDIO : ["Exit - ['CLAUDIO']"] : DUKE VINCENTIO
3.1 :Provost, a word with you! : None
Re-enter Provost : ["Re-enter - ['PROVOST']"] : DUKE VINCENTIO
PROVOST
3.1 :What's your will, father : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.1 :That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me : None
3.1 :awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my : None
3.1 :habit no loss shall touch her by my company. : None
PROVOST
3.1 :In good time. : None
Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward : ["Exit - ['PROVOST']", "None - ['ISABELLA']"] : PROVOST
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.1 :The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good: : None
3.1 :the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty : None
3.1 :brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of : None
3.1 :your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever : None
3.1 :fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you, : None
3.1 :fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but : None
3.1 :that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should : None
3.1 :wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this : None
3.1 :substitute, and to save your brother? : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my : None
3.1 :brother die by the law than my son should be : None
3.1 :unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke : None
3.1 :deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can : None
3.1 :speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or : None
3.1 :discover his government. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.1 :That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter : None
3.1 :now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made : None
3.1 :trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my : None
3.1 :advisings: to the love I have in doing good a : None
3.1 :remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe : None
3.1 :that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged : None
3.1 :lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from : None
3.1 :the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious : None
3.1 :person; and much please the absent duke, if : None
3.1 :peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of : None
3.1 :this business. : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do : None
3.1 :anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.1 :Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have : None
3.1 :you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of : None
3.1 :Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea? : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.1 :She should this Angelo have married; was affianced : None
3.1 :to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between : None
3.1 :which time of the contract and limit of the : None
3.1 :solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea, : None
3.1 :having in that perished vessel the dowry of his : None
3.1 :sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the : None
3.1 :poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and : None
3.1 :renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most : None
3.1 :kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of : None
3.1 :her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her : None
3.1 :combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo. : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her? : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.1 :Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them : None
3.1 :with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole, : None
3.1 :pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few, : None
3.1 :bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet : None
3.1 :wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears, : None
3.1 :is washed with them, but relents not. : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid : None
3.1 :from the world! What corruption in this life, that : None
3.1 :it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail? : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.1 :It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the : None
3.1 :cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps : None
3.1 :you from dishonour in doing it. : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :Show me how, good father. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.1 :This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance : None
3.1 :of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that : None
3.1 :in all reason should have quenched her love, hath, : None
3.1 :like an impediment in the current, made it more : None
3.1 :violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his : None
3.1 :requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with : None
3.1 :his demands to the point; only refer yourself to : None
3.1 :this advantage, first, that your stay with him may : None
3.1 :not be long; that the time may have all shadow and : None
3.1 :silence in it; and the place answer to convenience. : None
3.1 :This being granted in course,--and now follows : None
3.1 :all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up : None
3.1 :your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter : None
3.1 :acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to : None
3.1 :her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother : None
3.1 :saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana : None
3.1 :advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid : None
3.1 :will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you : None
3.1 :think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness : None
3.1 :of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof. : None
3.1 :What think you of it? : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :The image of it gives me content already; and I : None
3.1 :trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.1 :It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily : None
3.1 :to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his : None
3.1 :bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will : None
3.1 :presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated : None
3.1 :grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that : None
3.1 :place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that : None
3.1 :it may be quickly. : None
ISABELLA
3.1 :I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father. : None

DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :O heavens! what stuff is here : None

3.2 :upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have : None

DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd! : None
3.2 :The evil that thou causest to be done, : None
3.2 :That is thy means to live. Do thou but think : None

POMPEY
3.2 :Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet, : None
3.2 :sir, I would prove-- : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin, : None
3.2 :Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer: : None
3.2 :Correction and instruction must both work : None
3.2 :Ere this rude beast will profit. : None
ELBOW
3.2 :He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him : None
3.2 :warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if : None
3.2 :he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were : None

DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :That we were all, as some would seem to be, : None

LUCIO
3.2 :How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of : None
3.2 :Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there : None
3.2 :none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be : None

POMPEY
3.2 :Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she : None

3.2 :Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be : None
3.2 :so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd: : None
3.2 :an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going : None

POMPEY
3.2 :Yes, faith, sir. : None
LUCIO
3.2 :Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I : None

POMPEY
3.2 :I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail. : None
LUCIO
3.2 :No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear. : None
3.2 :I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If : None
3.2 :you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the : None

3.2 :What news, friar, of the duke? : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :I know none. Can you tell me of any? : None
LUCIO
3.2 :Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other : None
3.2 :some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you? : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well. : None
LUCIO
3.2 :It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from : None
3.2 :the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born : None
3.2 :to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he : None
3.2 :puts transgression to 't. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :He does well in 't. : None
LUCIO
3.2 :A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in : None
3.2 :him: something too crabbed that way, friar. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it. : None
LUCIO
3.2 :Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; : None
3.2 :it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp : None
3.2 :it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put : None
3.2 :down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and : None
3.2 :woman after this downright way of creation: is it : None
3.2 :true, think you? : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :How should he be made, then? : None
LUCIO
3.2 :Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he : None
3.2 :was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is : None
3.2 :certain that when he makes water his urine is : None
3.2 :congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a : None
3.2 :motion generative; that's infallible. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace. : None
LUCIO
3.2 :Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the : None
3.2 :rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a : None
3.2 :man! Would the duke that is absent have done this? : None
3.2 :Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a : None
3.2 :hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing : None
3.2 :a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he : None
3.2 :knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :I never heard the absent duke much detected for : None
3.2 :women; he was not inclined that way. : None
LUCIO
3.2 :O, sir, you are deceived. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :'Tis not possible. : None
LUCIO
3.2 :Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and : None
3.2 :his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the : None
3.2 :duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too; : None
3.2 :that let me inform you. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :You do him wrong, surely. : None
LUCIO
3.2 :Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the : None
3.2 :duke: and I believe I know the cause of his : None
3.2 :withdrawing. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :What, I prithee, might be the cause? : None
LUCIO
3.2 :No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the : None
3.2 :teeth and the lips: but this I can let you : None
3.2 :understand, the greater file of the subject held the : None
3.2 :duke to be wise. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :Wise! why, no question but he was. : None
LUCIO
3.2 :A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking: : None
3.2 :the very stream of his life and the business he hath : None
3.2 :helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better : None
3.2 :proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own : None
3.2 :bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the : None
3.2 :envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier. : None
3.2 :Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your : None
3.2 :knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice. : None
LUCIO
3.2 :Sir, I know him, and I love him. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with : None
3.2 :dearer love. : None
LUCIO
3.2 :Come, sir, I know what I know. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :I can hardly believe that, since you know not what : None
3.2 :you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our : None
3.2 :prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your : None
3.2 :answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke, : None
3.2 :you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call : None
3.2 :upon you; and, I pray you, your name? : None
LUCIO
3.2 :Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to : None
3.2 :report you. : None
LUCIO
3.2 :I fear you not. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you : None
3.2 :imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I : None
3.2 :can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again. : None
LUCIO
3.2 :I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me, : None
3.2 :friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if : None
3.2 :Claudio die to-morrow or no? : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :Why should he die, sir? : None
LUCIO
3.2 :Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would : None
3.2 :the duke we talk of were returned again: the : None
3.2 :ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with : None
3.2 :continency; sparrows must not build in his : None
3.2 :house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke : None
3.2 :yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would : None
3.2 :never bring them to light: would he were returned! : None
3.2 :Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing. : None
3.2 :Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The : None
3.2 :duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on : None
3.2 :Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee, : None
3.2 :he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown : None
3.2 :bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell. : None

3.2 :In special business from his holiness. : None
ESCALUS
3.2 :What news abroad i' the world? : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :None, but that there is so great a fever on : None
3.2 :goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it: : None
3.2 :novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous : None
3.2 :to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous : None
3.2 :to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce : None

ESCALUS
3.2 :One that, above all other strifes, contended : None

DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :What pleasure was he given to? : None
ESCALUS
3.2 :Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at : None

3.2 :his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous; : None
3.2 :and let me desire to know how you find Claudio : None

3.2 :lent him visitation. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
3.2 :He professes to have received no sinister measure : None
3.2 :from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself : None
3.2 :to the determination of justice: yet had he framed : None

PROVOST

4.2 :that is a prisoner nine years old. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
4.2 :How came it that the absent duke had not either : None
4.2 :delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I : None

PROVOST
4.2 :His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and, : None

PROVOST

4.2 :mortality, and desperately mortal. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
4.2 :He wants advice. : None
PROVOST
4.2 :He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty : None
4.2 :of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he : None
4.2 :would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days : None
4.2 :entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if : None
4.2 :to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming : None
4.2 :warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
4.2 :More of him anon. There is written in your brow, : None
4.2 :provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not : None
4.2 :truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the : None
4.2 :boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard. : None
4.2 :Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is : None
4.2 :no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath : None
4.2 :sentenced him. To make you understand this in a : None
4.2 :manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite; : None

DUKE VINCENTIO
4.2 :By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my : None

PROVOST
4.2 :Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
4.2 :O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it. : None
4.2 :Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was : None
4.2 :the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his : None
4.2 :death: you know the course is common. If any thing : None
4.2 :fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good : None

PROVOST
4.2 :Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
4.2 :Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy? : None
PROVOST
4.2 :To him, and to his substitutes. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
4.2 :You will think you have made no offence, if the duke : None
4.2 :avouch the justice of your dealing? : None
PROVOST
4.2 :But what likelihood is in that? : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
4.2 :Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see : None
4.2 :you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor : None
4.2 :persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go : None
4.2 :further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you. : None
4.2 :Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the : None
4.2 :duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the : None
4.2 :signet is not strange to you. : None
PROVOST
4.2 :I know them both. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
4.2 :The contents of this is the return of the duke: you : None
4.2 :shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you : None
4.2 :shall find, within these two days he will be here. : None
4.2 :This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this : None
4.2 :very day receives letters of strange tenor; : None
4.2 :perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering : None
4.2 :into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what : None
4.2 :is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the : None
4.2 :shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these : None
4.2 :things should be: all difficulties are but easy : None
4.2 :when they are known. Call your executioner, and off : None
4.2 :with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present : None
4.2 :shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you : None
4.2 :are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you. : None

ISABELLA
4.6 :To speak so indirectly I am loath: : None
4.6 :I would say the truth; but to accuse him so, : None
4.6 :That is your part: yet I am advised to do it; : None
4.6 :He says, to veil full purpose. : None
MARIANA
4.6 :Be ruled by him. : None
ISABELLA
4.6 :Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure : None

ANGELO

DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it, : None
5.1 :To lock it in the wards of covert bosom, : None
5.1 :When it deserves, with characters of brass, : None
5.1 :A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time : None
5.1 :And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand, : None
5.1 :And let the subject see, to make them know : None
5.1 :That outward courtesies would fain proclaim : None

5.1 :You must walk by us on our other hand; : None
5.1 :And good supporters are you. : None
FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward : ["None - ['FRIAR PETER', 'ISABELLA']"] : DUKE VINCENTIO
FRIAR PETER
5.1 :Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him. : None
ISABELLA
5.1 :Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard : None
5.1 :Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid! : None
5.1 :O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye : None
5.1 :By throwing it on any other object : None
5.1 :Till you have heard me in my true complaint : None
5.1 :And given me justice, justice, justice, justice! : None
DUKE VINCENTIO

5.1 :Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice: : None
5.1 :Reveal yourself to him. : None
ISABELLA
5.1 :O worthy duke, : None
5.1 :You bid me seek redemption of the devil: : None
5.1 :Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak : None
5.1 :Must either punish me, not being believed, : None
5.1 :Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here! : None
ANGELO
5.1 :My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm: : None
5.1 :She hath been a suitor to me for her brother : None
5.1 :Cut off by course of justice,-- : None
ISABELLA
5.1 :By course of justice! : None
ANGELO
5.1 :And she will speak most bitterly and strange. : None
ISABELLA
5.1 :Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak: : None
5.1 :That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange? : None
5.1 :That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange? : None
5.1 :That Angelo is an adulterous thief, : None
5.1 :An hypocrite, a virgin-violator; : None
5.1 :Is it not strange and strange? : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :Nay, it is ten times strange. : None
ISABELLA
5.1 :It is not truer he is Angelo : None
5.1 :Than this is all as true as it is strange: : None
5.1 :Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth : None
5.1 :To the end of reckoning. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :Away with her! Poor soul, : None
5.1 :She speaks this in the infirmity of sense. : None
ISABELLA
5.1 :O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest : None
5.1 :There is another comfort than this world, : None
5.1 :That thou neglect me not, with that opinion : None
5.1 :That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible : None
5.1 :That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible : None
5.1 :But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground, : None
5.1 :May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute : None
5.1 :As Angelo; even so may Angelo, : None
5.1 :In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms, : None
5.1 :Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince: : None
5.1 :If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more, : None

DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :By mine honesty, : None
5.1 :If she be mad,--as I believe no other,-- : None
5.1 :Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense, : None
5.1 :Such a dependency of thing on thing, : None
5.1 :As e'er I heard in madness. : None
ISABELLA
5.1 :O gracious duke, : None
5.1 :Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason : None
5.1 :For inequality; but let your reason serve : None
5.1 :To make the truth appear where it seems hid, : None
5.1 :And hide the false seems true. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :Many that are not mad : None
5.1 :Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say? : None
ISABELLA
5.1 :I am the sister of one Claudio, : None
5.1 :Condemn'd upon the act of fornication : None
5.1 :To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo: : None
5.1 :I, in probation of a sisterhood, : None
5.1 :Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio : None
5.1 :As then the messenger,-- : None
LUCIO
5.1 :That's I, an't like your grace: : None
5.1 :I came to her from Claudio, and desired her : None
5.1 :To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo : None
5.1 :For her poor brother's pardon. : None
ISABELLA
5.1 :That's he indeed. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :You were not bid to speak. : None
LUCIO
5.1 :No, my good lord; : None
5.1 :Nor wish'd to hold my peace. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :I wish you now, then; : None
5.1 :Pray you, take note of it: and when you have : None
5.1 :A business for yourself, pray heaven you then : None
5.1 :Be perfect. : None
LUCIO
5.1 :I warrant your honour. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :The warrants for yourself; take heed to't. : None
ISABELLA
5.1 :This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,-- : None
LUCIO
5.1 :Right. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :It may be right; but you are i' the wrong : None
5.1 :To speak before your time. Proceed. : None
ISABELLA
5.1 :I went : None
5.1 :To this pernicious caitiff deputy,-- : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :That's somewhat madly spoken. : None
ISABELLA
5.1 :Pardon it; : None
5.1 :The phrase is to the matter. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :Mended again. The matter; proceed. : None
ISABELLA
5.1 :In brief, to set the needless process by, : None
5.1 :How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd, : None
5.1 :How he refell'd me, and how I replied,-- : None
5.1 :For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion : None
5.1 :I now begin with grief and shame to utter: : None
5.1 :He would not, but by gift of my chaste body : None
5.1 :To his concupiscible intemperate lust, : None
5.1 :Release my brother; and, after much debatement, : None
5.1 :My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour, : None
5.1 :And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes, : None
5.1 :His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant : None
5.1 :For my poor brother's head. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :This is most likely! : None
ISABELLA
5.1 :O, that it were as like as it is true! : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st, : None
5.1 :Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour : None
5.1 :In hateful practise. First, his integrity : None
5.1 :Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason : None
5.1 :That with such vehemency he should pursue : None
5.1 :Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended, : None
5.1 :He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself : None
5.1 :And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on: : None
5.1 :Confess the truth, and say by whose advice : None
5.1 :Thou camest here to complain. : None
ISABELLA
5.1 :And is this all? : None
5.1 :Then, O you blessed ministers above, : None
5.1 :Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time : None
5.1 :Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up : None
5.1 :In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe, : None
5.1 :As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go! : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer! : None
5.1 :To prison with her! Shall we thus permit : None
5.1 :A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall : None
5.1 :On him so near us? This needs must be a practise. : None
5.1 :Who knew of Your intent and coming hither? : None
ISABELLA
5.1 :One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick? : None
LUCIO
5.1 :My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar; : None
5.1 :I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord : None
5.1 :For certain words he spake against your grace : None
5.1 :In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :Words against me? this is a good friar, belike! : None
5.1 :And to set on this wretched woman here : None
5.1 :Against our substitute! Let this friar be found. : None
LUCIO
5.1 :But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar, : None
5.1 :I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar, : None
5.1 :A very scurvy fellow. : None
FRIAR PETER
5.1 :Blessed be your royal grace! : None
5.1 :I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard : None
5.1 :Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman : None
5.1 :Most wrongfully accused your substitute, : None
5.1 :Who is as free from touch or soil with her : None
5.1 :As she from one ungot. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :We did believe no less. : None
5.1 :Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of? : None
FRIAR PETER
5.1 :I know him for a man divine and holy; : None
5.1 :Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler, : None
5.1 :As he's reported by this gentleman; : None
5.1 :And, on my trust, a man that never yet : None
5.1 :Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace. : None
LUCIO
5.1 :My lord, most villanously; believe it. : None
FRIAR PETER
5.1 :Well, he in time may come to clear himself; : None
5.1 :But at this instant he is sick my lord, : None
5.1 :Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request, : None
5.1 :Being come to knowledge that there was complaint : None
5.1 :Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither, : None
5.1 :To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know : None
5.1 :Is true and false; and what he with his oath : None
5.1 :And all probation will make up full clear, : None
5.1 :Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman. : None
5.1 :To justify this worthy nobleman, : None
5.1 :So vulgarly and personally accused, : None
5.1 :Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes, : None
5.1 :Till she herself confess it. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :Good friar, let's hear it. : None
ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forward : ["None - ['ISABELLA', 'MARIANA']"] : DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo? : None
5.1 :O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools! : None
5.1 :Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo; : None
5.1 :In this I'll be impartial; be you judge : None
5.1 :Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar? : None
5.1 :First, let her show her face, and after speak. : None
MARIANA
5.1 :Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face : None
5.1 :Until my husband bid me. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :What, are you married? : None
MARIANA
5.1 :No, my lord. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :Are you a maid? : None
MARIANA
5.1 :No, my lord. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :A widow, then? : None
MARIANA
5.1 :Neither, my lord. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife? : None
LUCIO
5.1 :My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are : None
5.1 :neither maid, widow, nor wife. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause : None
5.1 :To prattle for himself. : None
LUCIO
5.1 :Well, my lord. : None
MARIANA
5.1 :My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married; : None
5.1 :And I confess besides I am no maid: : None
5.1 :I have known my husband; yet my husband : None
5.1 :Knows not that ever he knew me. : None
LUCIO
5.1 :He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too! : None
LUCIO
5.1 :Well, my lord. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :This is no witness for Lord Angelo. : None
MARIANA
5.1 :Now I come to't my lord : None
5.1 :She that accuses him of fornication, : None
5.1 :In self-same manner doth accuse my husband, : None
5.1 :And charges him my lord, with such a time : None
5.1 :When I'll depose I had him in mine arms : None
5.1 :With all the effect of love. : None
ANGELO
5.1 :Charges she more than me? : None
MARIANA
5.1 :Not that I know. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :No? you say your husband. : None
MARIANA
5.1 :Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo, : None
5.1 :Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body, : None
5.1 :But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's. : None
ANGELO
5.1 :This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face. : None
MARIANA
5.1 :My husband bids me; now I will unmask. : None
Unveiling : ['None - []'] : MARIANA
5.1 :This is that face, thou cruel Angelo, : None
5.1 :Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on; : None
5.1 :This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract, : None
5.1 :Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body : None
5.1 :That took away the match from Isabel, : None
5.1 :And did supply thee at thy garden-house : None
5.1 :In her imagined person. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :Know you this woman? : None
LUCIO
5.1 :Carnally, she says. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :Sirrah, no more! : None
LUCIO
5.1 :Enough, my lord. : None
ANGELO
5.1 :My lord, I must confess I know this woman: : None
5.1 :And five years since there was some speech of marriage : None
5.1 :Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off, : None
5.1 :Partly for that her promised proportions : None
5.1 :Came short of composition, but in chief : None
5.1 :For that her reputation was disvalued : None
5.1 :In levity: since which time of five years : None
5.1 :I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her, : None
5.1 :Upon my faith and honour. : None
MARIANA
5.1 :Noble prince, : None
5.1 :As there comes light from heaven and words from breath, : None
5.1 :As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue, : None
5.1 :I am affianced this man's wife as strongly : None
5.1 :As words could make up vows: and, my good lord, : None
5.1 :But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house : None
5.1 :He knew me as a wife. As this is true, : None
5.1 :Let me in safety raise me from my knees : None
5.1 :Or else for ever be confixed here, : None
5.1 :A marble monument! : None
ANGELO
5.1 :                  I did but smile till now: : None
5.1 :Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice : None
5.1 :My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive : None
5.1 :These poor informal women are no more : None
5.1 :But instruments of some more mightier member : None
5.1 :That sets them on: let me have way, my lord, : None
5.1 :To find this practise out. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :Ay, with my heart : None
5.1 :And punish them to your height of pleasure. : None
5.1 :Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman, : None
5.1 :Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths, : None
5.1 :Though they would swear down each particular saint, : None
5.1 :Were testimonies against his worth and credit : None
5.1 :That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus, : None
5.1 :Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains : None
5.1 :To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived. : None
5.1 :There is another friar that set them on; : None
5.1 :Let him be sent for. : None
FRIAR PETER
5.1 :Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed : None
5.1 :Hath set the women on to this complaint: : None
5.1 :Your provost knows the place where he abides : None
5.1 :And he may fetch him. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :Go do it instantly. : None
Exit Provost : ["Exit - ['PROVOST']"] : DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin, : None
5.1 :Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth, : None
5.1 :Do with your injuries as seems you best, : None
5.1 :In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you; : None
5.1 :But stir not you till you have well determined : None
5.1 :Upon these slanderers. : None
ESCALUS
5.1 :My lord, we'll do it throughly. : None
Exit DUKE : ["Exit - ['DUKE']"] : ESCALUS
5.1 :Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that : None
5.1 :Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person? : None
LUCIO
5.1 :'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing : None
5.1 :but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most : None
5.1 :villanous speeches of the duke. : None
ESCALUS
5.1 :We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and : None
5.1 :enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a : None
5.1 :notable fellow. : None
LUCIO
5.1 :As any in Vienna, on my word. : None
ESCALUS
5.1 :Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her. : None
Exit an Attendant : ['Exit - []'] : ESCALUS
5.1 :Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you : None
5.1 :shall see how I'll handle her. : None
LUCIO
5.1 :Not better than he, by her own report. : None
ESCALUS
5.1 :Say you? : None
LUCIO
5.1 :Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately, : None
5.1 :she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly, : None
5.1 :she'll be ashamed. : None
ESCALUS
5.1 :I will go darkly to work with her. : None
LUCIO
5.1 :That's the way; for women are light at midnight. : None

5.1 :Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all : None
5.1 :that you have said. : None
LUCIO
5.1 :My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with : None
5.1 :the provost. : None
ESCALUS
5.1 :In very good time: speak not you to him till we : None
5.1 :call upon you. : None
LUCIO
5.1 :Mum. : None
ESCALUS
5.1 :Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander : None
5.1 :Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :'Tis false. : None
ESCALUS
5.1 :How! know you where you are? : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :Respect to your great place! and let the devil : None
5.1 :Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne! : None
5.1 :Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak. : None
ESCALUS
5.1 :The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak: : None
5.1 :Look you speak justly. : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls, : None
5.1 :Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox? : None
5.1 :Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone? : None
5.1 :Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust, : None
5.1 :Thus to retort your manifest appeal, : None
5.1 :And put your trial in the villain's mouth : None
5.1 :Which here you come to accuse. : None
LUCIO
5.1 :This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of. : None
ESCALUS
5.1 :Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar, : None
5.1 :Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women : None
5.1 :To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth : None
5.1 :And in the witness of his proper ear, : None
5.1 :To call him villain? and then to glance from him : None
5.1 :To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice? : None
5.1 :Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you : None
5.1 :Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose. : None
5.1 :What 'unjust'! : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :                  Be not so hot; the duke : None
5.1 :Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he : None
5.1 :Dare rack his own: his subject am I not, : None
5.1 :Nor here provincial. My business in this state : None
5.1 :Made me a looker on here in Vienna, : None
5.1 :Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble : None
5.1 :Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults, : None
5.1 :But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes : None
5.1 :Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop, : None
5.1 :As much in mock as mark. : None
ESCALUS
5.1 :Slander to the state! Away with him to prison! : None
ANGELO
5.1 :What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio? : None
5.1 :Is this the man that you did tell us of? : None
LUCIO
5.1 :'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate: : None
5.1 :do you know me? : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I : None
5.1 :met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke. : None
LUCIO
5.1 :O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke? : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :Most notedly, sir. : None
LUCIO
5.1 :Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a : None
5.1 :fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be? : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make : None
5.1 :that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and : None
5.1 :much more, much worse. : None
LUCIO
5.1 :O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the : None
5.1 :nose for thy speeches? : None
DUKE VINCENTIO
5.1 :I protest I love the duke as I love myself. : None
ANGELO
5.1 :Hark, how the villain would close now, after his : None
5.1 :treasonable abuses! : None
