1.3 :exceptions to your ill hours. : None
SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :Why, let her except, before excepted. : None
MARIA
1.3 :Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest : None

SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am: : None
1.3 :these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be : None
1.3 :these boots too: an they be not, let them hang : None

MARIA
1.3 :That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard : None

SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :Why, he has three thousand ducats a year. : None
MARIA
1.3 :Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats: : None
1.3 :he's a very fool and a prodigal. : None
SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the : None
1.3 :viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages : None
1.3 :word for word without book, and hath all the good : None
1.3 :gifts of nature. : None
MARIA
1.3 :He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides that : None
1.3 :he's a fool, he's a great quarreller: and but that : None
1.3 :he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he : None
1.3 :hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent : None
1.3 :he would quickly have the gift of a grave. : None
SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors : None
1.3 :that say so of him. Who are they? : None
MARIA
1.3 :They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company. : None
SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink to : None
1.3 :her as long as there is a passage in my throat and : None

MARIA
1.3 :My name is Mary, sir. : None
SIR ANDREW
1.3 :Good Mistress Mary Accost,-- : None
SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board : None
1.3 :her, woo her, assail her. : None
SIR ANDREW
1.3 :By my troth, I would not undertake her in this : None
1.3 :company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'? : None

MARIA

MARIA

SIR ANDREW

1.3 :see thee so put down? : None
SIR ANDREW
1.3 :Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary : None
1.3 :put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit : None
1.3 :than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a : None
1.3 :great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit. : None
SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :No question. : None
SIR ANDREW
1.3 :An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home : None
1.3 :to-morrow, Sir Toby. : None
SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :Pourquoi, my dear knight? : None
SIR ANDREW
1.3 :What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had : None

1.3 :fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but : None
1.3 :followed the arts! : None
SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair. : None
SIR ANDREW
1.3 :Why, would that have mended my hair? : None
SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature. : None
SIR ANDREW
1.3 :But it becomes me well enough, does't not? : None
SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I : None
1.3 :hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs : None
1.3 :and spin it off. : None
SIR ANDREW
1.3 :Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece : None
1.3 :will not be seen; or if she be, it's four to one : None
1.3 :she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her. : None
SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above : None

SIR ANDREW

SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight? : None
SIR ANDREW

SIR ANDREW
1.3 :Faith, I can cut a caper. : None
SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :And I can cut the mutton to't. : None
SIR ANDREW
1.3 :And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong : None
1.3 :as any man in Illyria. : None
SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have : None
1.3 :these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to : None
1.3 :take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost : None
1.3 :thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in : None
1.3 :a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not : None
1.3 :so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What : None
1.3 :dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in? : None
1.3 :I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy : None
1.3 :leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard. : None
SIR ANDREW
1.3 :Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a : None
1.3 :flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels? : None
SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus? : None
SIR ANDREW
1.3 :Taurus! That's sides and heart. : None
SIR TOBY BELCH
1.3 :No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the : None

DUKE ORSINO
1.4 :O, then unfold the passion of my love, : None

VIOLA

DUKE ORSINO
1.4 :Dear lad, believe it; : None
1.4 :For they shall yet belie thy happy years, : None

CLOWN

CLOWN

CLOWN
1.5 :Where, good Mistress Mary? : None
MARIA
1.5 :In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery. : None
CLOWN
1.5 :Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those : None
1.5 :that are fools, let them use their talents. : None
MARIA
1.5 :Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or, : None
1.5 :to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you? : None
CLOWN
1.5 :Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and, : None
1.5 :for turning away, let summer bear it out. : None
MARIA
1.5 :You are resolute, then? : None
CLOWN
1.5 :Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points. : None

1.5 :That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both : None

CLOWN
1.5 :Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way; if : None

CLOWN
1.5 :Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling! : None

1.5 :besides, you grow dishonest. : None
CLOWN
1.5 :Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel : None
1.5 :will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is : None
1.5 :the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend : None
1.5 :himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if : None
1.5 :he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing : None
1.5 :that's mended is but patched: virtue that : None
1.5 :transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that : None
1.5 :amends is but patched with virtue. If that this : None
1.5 :simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not, : None
1.5 :what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but : None
1.5 :calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take : None

OLIVIA
1.5 :Sir, I bade them take away you. : None
CLOWN
1.5 :Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non : None

OLIVIA
1.5 :Can you do it? : None
CLOWN

OLIVIA

OLIVIA
1.5 :What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend? : None
MALVOLIO
1.5 :Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him: : None

CLOWN
1.5 :God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the : None

OLIVIA
1.5 :How say you to that, Malvolio? : None
MALVOLIO
1.5 :I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a : None
1.5 :barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day : None
1.5 :with an ordinary fool that has no more brain : None
1.5 :than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard : None
1.5 :already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to : None

1.5 :than the fools' zanies. : None
OLIVIA
1.5 :Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste : None

VIOLA
3.1 :Art thou a churchman? : None
CLOWN
3.1 :No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for : None
3.1 :I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by : None
3.1 :the church. : None
VIOLA
3.1 :So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a : None

CLOWN
3.1 :You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is : None

VIOLA
3.1 :Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with : None

3.1 :I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir. : None
VIOLA
3.1 :Why, man? : None
CLOWN
3.1 :Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that : None

VIOLA
3.1 :Thy reason, man? : None
CLOWN

3.1 :to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible. : None
VIOLA
3.1 :Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool? : None
CLOWN
3.1 :No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she : None
3.1 :will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and : None
3.1 :fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to : None

3.4 :I sent for thee upon a sad occasion. : None
MALVOLIO

3.4 :Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: do : None

3.4 :Why, we shall make him mad indeed. : None
MARIA
3.4 :The house will be the quieter. : None
SIR TOBY BELCH
3.4 :Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound. My : None

SIR TOBY BELCH
3.4 :You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore, : None

VIOLA
3.4 :I pray you, sir, what is he? : None
SIR TOBY BELCH
3.4 :He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on : None

3.4 :his incensement at this moment is so implacable, : None

FABIAN
3.4 :Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by : None
