1.2 :I never sued to friend nor enemy; : None
1.2 :My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word; : None
1.2 :But now thy beauty is proposed my fee, : None
1.2 :My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak. : None
She looks scornfully at him : ['None - []'] : GLOUCESTER

CLARENCE
1.4 :O, I have pass'd a miserable night, : None
1.4 :So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams, : None
1.4 :That, as I am a Christian faithful man, : None
1.4 :I would not spend another such a night, : None
1.4 :Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days, : None

CLARENCE
1.4 :Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower, : None
1.4 :And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy; : None
1.4 :And, in my company, my brother Gloucester; : None
1.4 :Who from my cabin tempted me to walk : None
1.4 :Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England, : None
1.4 :And cited up a thousand fearful times, : None
1.4 :During the wars of York and Lancaster : None
1.4 :That had befall'n us. As we paced along : None
1.4 :Upon the giddy footing of the hatches, : None
1.4 :Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling, : None
1.4 :Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard, : None
1.4 :Into the tumbling billows of the main. : None
1.4 :Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown! : None

1.4 :Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, : None
1.4 :Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, : None

BRAKENBURY
1.4 :Had you such leisure in the time of death : None
1.4 :To gaze upon the secrets of the deep? : None
CLARENCE
1.4 :Methought I had; and often did I strive : None
1.4 :To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood : None
1.4 :Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth : None
1.4 :To seek the empty, vast and wandering air; : None
1.4 :But smother'd it within my panting bulk, : None
1.4 :Which almost burst to belch it in the sea. : None
BRAKENBURY
1.4 :Awaked you not with this sore agony? : None
CLARENCE
1.4 :O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life; : None
1.4 :O, then began the tempest to my soul, : None
1.4 :Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood, : None
1.4 :With that grim ferryman which poets write of, : None
1.4 :Unto the kingdom of perpetual night. : None

1.4 :And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by : None

FIRST MURDERER

SECOND MURDERER
1.4 :When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till : None
1.4 :the judgment-day. : None
FIRST MURDERER
1.4 :Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping. : None
SECOND MURDERER
1.4 :The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind : None
1.4 :of remorse in me. : None
FIRST MURDERER
1.4 :What, art thou afraid? : None
SECOND MURDERER
1.4 :Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be : None
1.4 :damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us. : None
FIRST MURDERER
1.4 :I thought thou hadst been resolute. : None
SECOND MURDERER
1.4 :So I am, to let him live. : None
FIRST MURDERER
1.4 :Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so. : None
SECOND MURDERER

SECOND MURDERER
1.4 :Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it. : None
FIRST MURDERER
1.4 :How if it come to thee again? : None
SECOND MURDERER
1.4 :I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it : None
1.4 :makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it : None
1.4 :accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him; : None
1.4 :he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it : None
1.4 :detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that : None
1.4 :mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of : None
1.4 :obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold : None
1.4 :that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it : None
1.4 :is turned out of all towns and cities for a : None
1.4 :dangerous thing; and every man that means to live : None

1.4 :without it. : None
FIRST MURDERER
1.4 :'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me : None

FIRST MURDERER
1.4 :Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me, : None
1.4 :I warrant thee. : None
SECOND MURDERER
1.4 :Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his : None
1.4 :reputation. Come, shall we to this gear? : None
FIRST MURDERER
1.4 :Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy : None
1.4 :sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt : None
1.4 :in the next room. : None
SECOND MURDERER
1.4 :O excellent devise! make a sop of him. : None
FIRST MURDERER
1.4 :Hark! he stirs: shall I strike? : None
SECOND MURDERER

CLARENCE
1.4 :To murder me? : None
BOTH
1.4 :Ay, ay. : None
CLARENCE
1.4 :You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so, : None
1.4 :And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it. : None
1.4 :Wherein, my friends, have I offended you? : None
FIRST MURDERER
1.4 :Offended us you have not, but the king. : None
CLARENCE
1.4 :I shall be reconciled to him again. : None
SECOND MURDERER
1.4 :Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die. : None
CLARENCE
1.4 :Are you call'd forth from out a world of men : None
1.4 :To slay the innocent? What is my offence? : None
1.4 :Where are the evidence that do accuse me? : None

1.4 :That you depart and lay no hands on me : None
1.4 :The deed you undertake is damnable. : None
FIRST MURDERER
1.4 :What we will do, we do upon command. : None
SECOND MURDERER
1.4 :And he that hath commanded is the king. : None
CLARENCE
1.4 :Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings : None
1.4 :Hath in the tables of his law commanded : None
1.4 :That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then, : None
1.4 :Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's? : None
1.4 :Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands, : None
1.4 :To hurl upon their heads that break his law. : None
SECOND MURDERER
1.4 :And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee, : None
1.4 :For false forswearing and for murder too: : None
1.4 :Thou didst receive the holy sacrament, : None
1.4 :To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster. : None
FIRST MURDERER
1.4 :And, like a traitor to the name of God, : None
1.4 :Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade : None
1.4 :Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son. : None
SECOND MURDERER
1.4 :Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend. : None
FIRST MURDERER
1.4 :How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us, : None
1.4 :When thou hast broke it in so dear degree? : None
CLARENCE
1.4 :Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed? : None
1.4 :For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs, : None
1.4 :He sends ye not to murder me for this : None
1.4 :For in this sin he is as deep as I. : None
1.4 :If God will be revenged for this deed. : None
1.4 :O, know you yet, he doth it publicly, : None
1.4 :Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm; : None
1.4 :He needs no indirect nor lawless course : None
1.4 :To cut off those that have offended him. : None
FIRST MURDERER
1.4 :Who made thee, then, a bloody minister, : None
1.4 :When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet, : None

1.4 :I am his brother, and I love him well. : None
1.4 :If you be hired for meed, go back again, : None
1.4 :And I will send you to my brother Gloucester, : None
1.4 :Who shall reward you better for my life : None
1.4 :Than Edward will for tidings of my death. : None
SECOND MURDERER
1.4 :You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you. : None
CLARENCE
1.4 :O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear: : None
1.4 :Go you to him from me. : None
BOTH
1.4 :Ay, so we will. : None
CLARENCE
1.4 :Tell him, when that our princely father York : None
1.4 :Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm, : None
1.4 :And charged us from his soul to love each other, : None
1.4 :He little thought of this divided friendship: : None
1.4 :Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep. : None
FIRST MURDERER
1.4 :Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep. : None
CLARENCE
1.4 :O, do not slander him, for he is kind. : None
FIRST MURDERER
1.4 :Right, : None
1.4 :As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself: : None
1.4 :'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee. : None
CLARENCE
1.4 :It cannot be; for when I parted with him, : None
1.4 :He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs, : None
1.4 :That he would labour my delivery. : None
SECOND MURDERER
1.4 :Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee : None
1.4 :From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven. : None
FIRST MURDERER

CLARENCE
1.4 :Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul, : None
1.4 :To counsel me to make my peace with God, : None
1.4 :And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind, : None
1.4 :That thou wilt war with God by murdering me? : None
1.4 :Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on : None
1.4 :To do this deed will hate you for the deed. : None

FIRST MURDERER
1.4 :Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish. : None
CLARENCE
1.4 :Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish. : None
1.4 :Which of you, if you were a prince's son, : None
1.4 :Being pent from liberty, as I am now, : None
1.4 :if two such murderers as yourselves came to you, : None
