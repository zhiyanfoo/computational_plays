FLAVIUS
1.1 :Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home: : None
1.1 :Is this a holiday? what! know you not, : None
1.1 :Being mechanical, you ought not walk : None
1.1 :Upon a labouring day without the sign : None
1.1 :Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou? : None
FIRST COMMONER
1.1 :Why, sir, a carpenter. : None
MARULLUS
1.1 :Where is thy leather apron and thy rule? : None
1.1 :What dost thou with thy best apparel on? : None
1.1 :You, sir, what trade are you? : None
SECOND COMMONER
1.1 :Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but, : None
1.1 :as you would say, a cobbler. : None
MARULLUS
1.1 :But what trade art thou? answer me directly. : None
SECOND COMMONER
1.1 :A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe : None
1.1 :conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles. : None
MARULLUS
1.1 :What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade? : None
SECOND COMMONER
1.1 :Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet, : None
1.1 :if you be out, sir, I can mend you. : None
MARULLUS
1.1 :What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow! : None
SECOND COMMONER
1.1 :Why, sir, cobble you. : None
FLAVIUS
1.1 :Thou art a cobbler, art thou? : None
SECOND COMMONER
1.1 :Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I : None
1.1 :meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's : None
1.1 :matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon : None
1.1 :to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I : None
1.1 :recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon : None
1.1 :neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork. : None
FLAVIUS
1.1 :But wherefore art not in thy shop today? : None
1.1 :Why dost thou lead these men about the streets? : None
SECOND COMMONER
1.1 :Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself : None
1.1 :into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday, : None
1.1 :to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph. : None
MARULLUS
1.1 :Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home? : None
1.1 :What tributaries follow him to Rome, : None
1.1 :To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels? : None
1.1 :You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things! : None
1.1 :O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome, : None
1.1 :Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft : None
1.1 :Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements, : None
1.1 :To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops, : None
1.1 :Your infants in your arms, and there have sat : None
1.1 :The livelong day, with patient expectation, : None
1.1 :To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome: : None
1.1 :And when you saw his chariot but appear, : None
1.1 :Have you not made an universal shout, : None
1.1 :That Tiber trembled underneath her banks, : None
1.1 :To hear the replication of your sounds : None
1.1 :Made in her concave shores? : None
1.1 :And do you now put on your best attire? : None
1.1 :And do you now cull out a holiday? : None
1.1 :And do you now strew flowers in his way : None
1.1 :That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone! : None
1.1 :Run to your houses, fall upon your knees, : None
1.1 :Pray to the gods to intermit the plague : None
1.1 :That needs must light on this ingratitude. : None
FLAVIUS
1.1 :Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault, : None
1.1 :Assemble all the poor men of your sort; : None
1.1 :Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears : None
1.1 :Into the channel, till the lowest stream : None
1.1 :Do kiss the most exalted shores of all. : None
Exeunt all the Commoners : ["Exeunt - ['ALL']"] : FLAVIUS
1.1 :See whether their basest metal be not moved; : None
1.1 :They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness. : None
1.1 :Go you down that way towards the Capitol; : None
THIS WAY WILL I
1.1 :disrobe the images, : None
1.1 :If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies. : None
MARULLUS
1.1 :May we do so? : None
1.1 :You know it is the feast of Lupercal. : None
FLAVIUS
1.1 :It is no matter; let no images : None
1.1 :Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about, : None
1.1 :And drive away the vulgar from the streets: : None
1.1 :So do you too, where you perceive them thick. : None
1.1 :These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing : None
1.1 :Will make him fly an ordinary pitch, : None
1.1 :Who else would soar above the view of men : None
1.1 :And keep us all in servile fearfulness. : None
Exeunt : ['Exeunt - []'] : FLAVIUS

Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course;  CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,  CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among them a Soothsayer : ['None - []', "Enter - ['CAESAR', 'ANTONY', 'CALPURNIA', 'PORTIA', 'DECIUS BRUTUS', 'CICERO', 'BRUTUS', 'CASSIUS', 'CASCA', 'SOOTHSAYER']"] : FLAVIUS
CAESAR
1.2 :Calpurnia! : None
CASCA
1.2 :         Peace, ho! Caesar speaks. : None
CAESAR
1.2 :Calpurnia! : None
CALPURNIA
1.2 :Here, my lord. : None
CAESAR
1.2 :Stand you directly in Antonius' way, : None
1.2 :When he doth run his course. Antonius! : None
ANTONY
1.2 :Caesar, my lord? : None
CAESAR
1.2 :Forget not, in your speed, Antonius, : None
1.2 :To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say, : None
1.2 :The barren, touched in this holy chase, : None
1.2 :Shake off their sterile curse. : None
ANTONY
1.2 :I shall remember: : None
1.2 :When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd. : None
CAESAR
1.2 :Set on; and leave no ceremony out. : None
Flourish : ['None - []'] : CAESAR
SOOTHSAYER
1.2 :Caesar! : None
CAESAR
1.2 :Ha! who calls? : None
CASCA
1.2 :Bid every noise be still: peace yet again! : None
CAESAR
1.2 :Who is it in the press that calls on me? : None
1.2 :I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music, : None
1.2 :Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear. : None
SOOTHSAYER
1.2 :Beware the ides of March. : None
CAESAR
1.2 :What man is that? : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March. : None
CAESAR
1.2 :Set him before me; let me see his face. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar. : None
CAESAR
1.2 :What say'st thou to me now? speak once again. : None
SOOTHSAYER
1.2 :Beware the ides of March. : None
CAESAR
1.2 :He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass. : None
Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS : ['None - []', "Exeunt - ['ALL', 'BRUTUS', 'CASSIUS']"] : CAESAR
CASSIUS
1.2 :Will you go see the order of the course? : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :Not I. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :I pray you, do. : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :I am not gamesome: I do lack some part : None
1.2 :Of that quick spirit that is in Antony. : None
1.2 :Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires; : None
1.2 :I'll leave you. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :Brutus, I do observe you now of late: : None
1.2 :I have not from your eyes that gentleness : None
1.2 :And show of love as I was wont to have: : None
1.2 :You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand : None
1.2 :Over your friend that loves you. : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :Cassius, : None
1.2 :Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look, : None
1.2 :I turn the trouble of my countenance : None
1.2 :Merely upon myself. Vexed I am : None
1.2 :Of late with passions of some difference, : None
1.2 :Conceptions only proper to myself, : None
1.2 :Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors; : None
1.2 :But let not therefore my good friends be grieved-- : None
1.2 :Among which number, Cassius, be you one-- : None
1.2 :Nor construe any further my neglect, : None
1.2 :Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war, : None
1.2 :Forgets the shows of love to other men. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion; : None
1.2 :By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried : None
1.2 :Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations. : None
1.2 :Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face? : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself, : None
1.2 :But by reflection, by some other things. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :'Tis just: : None
1.2 :And it is very much lamented, Brutus, : None
1.2 :That you have no such mirrors as will turn : None
1.2 :Your hidden worthiness into your eye, : None
1.2 :That you might see your shadow. I have heard, : None
1.2 :Where many of the best respect in Rome, : None
1.2 :Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus : None
1.2 :And groaning underneath this age's yoke, : None
1.2 :Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes. : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius, : None
1.2 :That you would have me seek into myself : None
1.2 :For that which is not in me? : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear: : None
1.2 :And since you know you cannot see yourself : None
1.2 :So well as by reflection, I, your glass, : None
1.2 :Will modestly discover to yourself : None
1.2 :That of yourself which you yet know not of. : None
1.2 :And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus: : None
1.2 :Were I a common laugher, or did use : None
1.2 :To stale with ordinary oaths my love : None
1.2 :To every new protester; if you know : None
1.2 :That I do fawn on men and hug them hard : None
1.2 :And after scandal them, or if you know : None
1.2 :That I profess myself in banqueting : None
1.2 :To all the rout, then hold me dangerous. : None
Flourish, and shout : ['None - []'] : CASSIUS
BRUTUS
1.2 :What means this shouting? I do fear, the people : None
1.2 :Choose Caesar for their king. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :Ay, do you fear it? : None
1.2 :Then must I think you would not have it so. : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well. : None
1.2 :But wherefore do you hold me here so long? : None
1.2 :What is it that you would impart to me? : None
1.2 :If it be aught toward the general good, : None
1.2 :Set honour in one eye and death i' the other, : None
1.2 :And I will look on both indifferently, : None
1.2 :For let the gods so speed me as I love : None
1.2 :The name of honour more than I fear death. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus, : None
1.2 :As well as I do know your outward favour. : None
1.2 :Well, honour is the subject of my story. : None
1.2 :I cannot tell what you and other men : None
1.2 :Think of this life; but, for my single self, : None
1.2 :I had as lief not be as live to be : None
1.2 :In awe of such a thing as I myself. : None
1.2 :I was born free as Caesar; so were you: : None
1.2 :We both have fed as well, and we can both : None
1.2 :Endure the winter's cold as well as he: : None
1.2 :For once, upon a raw and gusty day, : None
1.2 :The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores, : None
1.2 :Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now : None
1.2 :Leap in with me into this angry flood, : None
1.2 :And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word, : None
1.2 :Accoutred as I was, I plunged in : None
1.2 :And bade him follow; so indeed he did. : None
1.2 :The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it : None
1.2 :With lusty sinews, throwing it aside : None
1.2 :And stemming it with hearts of controversy; : None
1.2 :But ere we could arrive the point proposed, : None
1.2 :Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!' : None
1.2 :I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor, : None
1.2 :Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder : None
1.2 :The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber : None
1.2 :Did I the tired Caesar. And this man : None
1.2 :Is now become a god, and Cassius is : None
1.2 :A wretched creature and must bend his body, : None
1.2 :If Caesar carelessly but nod on him. : None
1.2 :He had a fever when he was in Spain, : None
1.2 :And when the fit was on him, I did mark : None
1.2 :How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake; : None
1.2 :His coward lips did from their colour fly, : None
1.2 :And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world : None
1.2 :Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan: : None
1.2 :Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans : None
1.2 :Mark him and write his speeches in their books, : None
1.2 :Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,' : None
1.2 :As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me : None
1.2 :A man of such a feeble temper should : None
1.2 :So get the start of the majestic world : None
1.2 :And bear the palm alone. : None
Shout. Flourish : ['None - []', 'None - []'] : CASSIUS
BRUTUS
1.2 :Another general shout! : None
1.2 :I do believe that these applauses are : None
1.2 :For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world : None
1.2 :Like a Colossus, and we petty men : None
1.2 :Walk under his huge legs and peep about : None
1.2 :To find ourselves dishonourable graves. : None
1.2 :Men at some time are masters of their fates: : None
1.2 :The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, : None
1.2 :But in ourselves, that we are underlings. : None
1.2 :Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'? : None
1.2 :Why should that name be sounded more than yours? : None
1.2 :Write them together, yours is as fair a name; : None
1.2 :Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well; : None
1.2 :Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em, : None
1.2 :Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar. : None
1.2 :Now, in the names of all the gods at once, : None
1.2 :Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed, : None
1.2 :That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed! : None
1.2 :Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods! : None
1.2 :When went there by an age, since the great flood, : None
1.2 :But it was famed with more than with one man? : None
1.2 :When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome, : None
1.2 :That her wide walls encompass'd but one man? : None
1.2 :Now is it Rome indeed and room enough, : None
1.2 :When there is in it but one only man. : None
1.2 :O, you and I have heard our fathers say, : None
1.2 :There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd : None
1.2 :The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome : None
1.2 :As easily as a king. : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :That you do love me, I am nothing jealous; : None
1.2 :What you would work me to, I have some aim: : None
1.2 :How I have thought of this and of these times, : None
1.2 :I shall recount hereafter; for this present, : None
1.2 :I would not, so with love I might entreat you, : None
1.2 :Be any further moved. What you have said : None
1.2 :I will consider; what you have to say : None
1.2 :I will with patience hear, and find a time : None
1.2 :Both meet to hear and answer such high things. : None
1.2 :Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this: : None
1.2 :Brutus had rather be a villager : None
1.2 :Than to repute himself a son of Rome : None
1.2 :Under these hard conditions as this time : None
1.2 :Is like to lay upon us. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :I am glad that my weak words : None
1.2 :Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus. : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :The games are done and Caesar is returning. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve; : None
1.2 :And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you : None
1.2 :What hath proceeded worthy note to-day. : None
Re-enter CAESAR and his Train : ["Re-enter - ['CAESAR']"] : CASSIUS
BRUTUS
1.2 :I will do so. But, look you, Cassius, : None
1.2 :The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow, : None
1.2 :And all the rest look like a chidden train: : None
1.2 :Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero : None
1.2 :Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes : None
1.2 :As we have seen him in the Capitol, : None
1.2 :Being cross'd in conference by some senators. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :Casca will tell us what the matter is. : None
CAESAR
1.2 :Antonius! : None
ANTONY
1.2 :Caesar? : None
CAESAR
1.2 :Let me have men about me that are fat; : None
1.2 :Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights: : None
1.2 :Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look; : None
1.2 :He thinks too much: such men are dangerous. : None
ANTONY
1.2 :Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous; : None
1.2 :He is a noble Roman and well given. : None
CAESAR
1.2 :Would he were fatter! But I fear him not: : None
1.2 :Yet if my name were liable to fear, : None
1.2 :I do not know the man I should avoid : None
1.2 :So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much; : None
1.2 :He is a great observer and he looks : None
1.2 :Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays, : None
1.2 :As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music; : None
1.2 :Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort : None
1.2 :As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit : None
1.2 :That could be moved to smile at any thing. : None
1.2 :Such men as he be never at heart's ease : None
1.2 :Whiles they behold a greater than themselves, : None
1.2 :And therefore are they very dangerous. : None
1.2 :I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd : None
1.2 :Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar. : None
1.2 :Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf, : None
1.2 :And tell me truly what thou think'st of him. : None
Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA : ['None - []', "Exeunt - ['CAESAR', 'ALL', 'CASCA']"] : CAESAR
CASCA
1.2 :You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me? : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day, : None
1.2 :That Caesar looks so sad. : None
CASCA
1.2 :Why, you were with him, were you not? : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :I should not then ask Casca what had chanced. : None
CASCA
1.2 :Why, there was a crown offered him: and being : None
1.2 :offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand, : None
1.2 :thus; and then the people fell a-shouting. : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :What was the second noise for? : None
CASCA
1.2 :Why, for that too. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for? : None
CASCA
1.2 :Why, for that too. : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :Was the crown offered him thrice? : None
CASCA
1.2 :Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every : None
1.2 :time gentler than other, and at every putting-by : None
1.2 :mine honest neighbours shouted. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :Who offered him the crown? : None
CASCA
1.2 :Why, Antony. : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca. : None
CASCA
1.2 :I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it: : None
1.2 :it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark : None
1.2 :Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown : None
1.2 :neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told : None
1.2 :you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my : None
1.2 :thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he : None
1.2 :offered it to him again; then he put it by again: : None
1.2 :but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his : None
1.2 :fingers off it. And then he offered it the third : None
1.2 :time; he put it the third time by: and still as he : None
1.2 :refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their : None
1.2 :chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps : None
1.2 :and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because : None
1.2 :Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked : None
1.2 :Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and : None
1.2 :for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of : None
1.2 :opening my lips and receiving the bad air. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound? : None
CASCA
1.2 :He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at : None
1.2 :mouth, and was speechless. : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I, : None
1.2 :And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness. : None
CASCA
1.2 :I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure, : None
1.2 :Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not : None
1.2 :clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and : None
1.2 :displeased them, as they use to do the players in : None
1.2 :the theatre, I am no true man. : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :What said he when he came unto himself? : None
CASCA
1.2 :Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the : None
1.2 :common herd was glad he refused the crown, he : None
1.2 :plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his : None
1.2 :throat to cut. An I had been a man of any : None
1.2 :occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word, : None
1.2 :I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so : None
1.2 :he fell. When he came to himself again, he said, : None
1.2 :If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired : None
1.2 :their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three : None
1.2 :or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good : None
1.2 :soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but : None
1.2 :there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had : None
1.2 :stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less. : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :And after that, he came, thus sad, away? : None
CASCA
1.2 :Ay. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :Did Cicero say any thing? : None
CASCA
1.2 :Ay, he spoke Greek. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :To what effect? : None
CASCA
1.2 :Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the : None
1.2 :face again: but those that understood him smiled at : None
1.2 :one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own : None
1.2 :part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more : None
1.2 :news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs : None
1.2 :off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you : None
1.2 :well. There was more foolery yet, if I could : None
1.2 :remember it. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :Will you sup with me to-night, Casca? : None
CASCA
1.2 :No, I am promised forth. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :Will you dine with me to-morrow? : None
CASCA
1.2 :Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner : None
1.2 :worth the eating. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :Good: I will expect you. : None
CASCA
1.2 :Do so. Farewell, both. : None
Exit : ['Exit - []'] : CASCA
BRUTUS
1.2 :What a blunt fellow is this grown to be! : None
1.2 :He was quick mettle when he went to school. : None
CASSIUS
1.2 :So is he now in execution : None
1.2 :Of any bold or noble enterprise, : None
1.2 :However he puts on this tardy form. : None
1.2 :This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit, : None
1.2 :Which gives men stomach to digest his words : None
1.2 :With better appetite. : None
BRUTUS
1.2 :And so it is. For this time I will leave you: : None
1.2 :To-morrow, if you please to speak with me, : None
1.2 :I will come home to you; or, if you will, : None

1.3 :Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home? : None
1.3 :Why are you breathless? and why stare you so? : None
CASCA
1.3 :Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth : None
1.3 :Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero, : None
1.3 :I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds : None
1.3 :Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen : None
1.3 :The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam, : None
1.3 :To be exalted with the threatening clouds: : None
1.3 :But never till to-night, never till now, : None
1.3 :Did I go through a tempest dropping fire. : None
1.3 :Either there is a civil strife in heaven, : None

CICERO
1.3 :Why, saw you any thing more wonderful? : None
CASCA
1.3 :A common slave--you know him well by sight-- : None
1.3 :Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn : None

1.3 :And yesterday the bird of night did sit : None

CICERO
1.3 :Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time: : None

1.3 :Clean from the purpose of the things themselves. : None
1.3 :Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow? : None
CASCA

1.3 :The breast of heaven, I did present myself : None
1.3 :Even in the aim and very flash of it. : None
CASCA
1.3 :But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens? : None
1.3 :It is the part of men to fear and tremble, : None

CASSIUS
1.3 :You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life : None
1.3 :That should be in a Roman you do want, : None
1.3 :Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze : None
1.3 :And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder, : None

1.3 :But if you would consider the true cause : None
1.3 :Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts, : None

1.3 :Unto some monstrous state. : None
1.3 :Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man : None
1.3 :Most like this dreadful night, : None

1.3 :Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass, : None
1.3 :Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron, : None

CASSIUS
1.3 :And why should Caesar be a tyrant then? : None
1.3 :Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf, : None

1.3 :Those that with haste will make a mighty fire : None

2.1 :It is the bright day that brings forth the adder; : None

2.1 :Will bear no colour for the thing he is, : None
2.1 :Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented, : None

2.1 :Let Antony and Caesar fall together. : None
BRUTUS
2.1 :Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius, : None
2.1 :To cut the head off and then hack the limbs, : None
2.1 :Like wrath in death and envy afterwards; : None

2.1 :Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius. : None
2.1 :We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar; : None
2.1 :And in the spirit of men there is no blood: : None

3.2 :why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: : None
3.2 :--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved : None
3.2 :Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and : None

3.2 :as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was : None
3.2 :valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I : None
3.2 :slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his : None
