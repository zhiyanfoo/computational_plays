1.1 :Without the sensible and true avouch : None
1.1 :Of mine own eyes. : None
MARCELLUS
1.1 :                  Is it not like the king? : None
HORATIO
1.1 :As thou art to thyself: : None
1.1 :Such was the very armour he had on : None
1.1 :When he the ambitious Norway combated; : None
1.1 :So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle, : None
1.1 :He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice. : None
1.1 :'Tis strange. : None
MARCELLUS
1.1 :Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour, : None
1.1 :With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch. : None
HORATIO
1.1 :In what particular thought to work I know not; : None
1.1 :But in the gross and scope of my opinion, : None
1.1 :This bodes some strange eruption to our state. : None
MARCELLUS
1.1 :Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows, : None
1.1 :Why this same strict and most observant watch : None
1.1 :So nightly toils the subject of the land, : None
1.1 :And why such daily cast of brazen cannon, : None
1.1 :And foreign mart for implements of war; : None
1.1 :Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task : None
1.1 :Does not divide the Sunday from the week; : None
1.1 :What might be toward, that this sweaty haste : None
1.1 :Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day: : None
1.1 :Who is't that can inform me? : None
HORATIO
1.1 :That can I; : None
1.1 :At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king, : None
1.1 :Whose image even but now appear'd to us, : None
1.1 :Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway, : None
1.1 :Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride, : None
1.1 :Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet-- : None
1.1 :For so this side of our known world esteem'd him-- : None
1.1 :Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact, : None
1.1 :Well ratified by law and heraldry, : None
1.1 :Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands : None
1.1 :Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror: : None
1.1 :Against the which, a moiety competent : None
1.1 :Was gaged by our king; which had return'd : None
1.1 :To the inheritance of Fortinbras, : None
1.1 :Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant, : None
1.1 :And carriage of the article design'd, : None
1.1 :His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras, : None
1.1 :Of unimproved mettle hot and full, : None
1.1 :Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there : None
1.1 :Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes, : None
1.1 :For food and diet, to some enterprise : None
1.1 :That hath a stomach in't; which is no other-- : None
1.1 :As it doth well appear unto our state-- : None
1.1 :But to recover of us, by strong hand : None
1.1 :And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands : None
1.1 :So by his father lost: and this, I take it, : None
1.1 :Is the main motive of our preparations, : None
1.1 :The source of this our watch and the chief head : None
1.1 :Of this post-haste and romage in the land. : None
BERNARDO
1.1 :I think it be no other but e'en so: : None
1.1 :Well may it sort that this portentous figure : None
1.1 :Comes armed through our watch; so like the king : None
1.1 :That was and is the question of these wars. : None
HORATIO
1.1 :A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye. : None
1.1 :In the most high and palmy state of Rome, : None
1.1 :A little ere the mightiest Julius fell, : None
1.1 :The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead : None
1.1 :Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets: : None
1.1 :As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood, : None
1.1 :Disasters in the sun; and the moist star : None
1.1 :Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands : None
1.1 :Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse: : None
1.1 :And even the like precurse of fierce events, : None
1.1 :As harbingers preceding still the fates : None
1.1 :And prologue to the omen coming on, : None
1.1 :Have heaven and earth together demonstrated : None
1.1 :Unto our climatures and countrymen.-- : None
1.1 :But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again! : None
Re-enter Ghost : ["Re-enter - ['GHOST']"] : HORATIO
1.1 :I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion! : None
1.1 :If thou hast any sound, or use of voice, : None
1.1 :Speak to me: : None
1.1 :If there be any good thing to be done, : None
1.1 :That may to thee do ease and grace to me, : None
1.1 :Speak to me: : None
Cock crows : ['None - []'] : HORATIO
1.1 :If thou art privy to thy country's fate, : None
1.1 :Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak! : None
1.1 :Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life : None
1.1 :Extorted treasure in the womb of earth, : None
1.1 :For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death, : None
1.1 :Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus. : None
MARCELLUS
1.1 :Shall I strike at it with my partisan? : None
HORATIO
1.1 :Do, if it will not stand. : None
BERNARDO
1.1 :'Tis here! : None
HORATIO
1.1 :'Tis here! : None
MARCELLUS
1.1 :'Tis gone! : None
Exit Ghost : ["Exit - ['GHOST']"] : MARCELLUS
1.1 :We do it wrong, being so majestical, : None
1.1 :To offer it the show of violence; : None
1.1 :For it is, as the air, invulnerable, : None
1.1 :And our vain blows malicious mockery. : None
BERNARDO
1.1 :It was about to speak, when the cock crew. : None
HORATIO
1.1 :And then it started like a guilty thing : None
1.1 :Upon a fearful summons. I have heard, : None
1.1 :The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn, : None
1.1 :Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat : None
1.1 :Awake the god of day; and, at his warning, : None
1.1 :Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air, : None
1.1 :The extravagant and erring spirit hies : None
1.1 :To his confine: and of the truth herein : None
1.1 :This present object made probation. : None
MARCELLUS
1.1 :It faded on the crowing of the cock. : None
1.1 :Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes : None
1.1 :Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated, : None
1.1 :The bird of dawning singeth all night long: : None
1.1 :And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad; : None
1.1 :The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike, : None
1.1 :No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm, : None
1.1 :So hallow'd and so gracious is the time. : None
HORATIO
1.1 :So have I heard and do in part believe it. : None
1.1 :But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad, : None
1.1 :Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill: : None
1.1 :Break we our watch up; and by my advice, : None
1.1 :Let us impart what we have seen to-night : None
1.1 :Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life, : None
1.1 :This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him. : None
1.1 :Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, : None
1.1 :As needful in our loves, fitting our duty? : None
MARCELLUS
1.1 :Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know : None
1.1 :Where we shall find him most conveniently. : None

1.2 :To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom : None
1.2 :To be contracted in one brow of woe, : None

1.2 :Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd : None
1.2 :Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone : None
1.2 :With this affair along. For all, our thanks. : None
1.2 :Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras, : None
1.2 :Holding a weak supposal of our worth, : None
1.2 :Or thinking by our late dear brother's death : None
1.2 :Our state to be disjoint and out of frame, : None
1.2 :Colleagued with the dream of his advantage, : None

1.2 :Importing the surrender of those lands : None
1.2 :Lost by his father, with all bonds of law, : None

1.2 :To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,-- : None
1.2 :Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears : None
1.2 :Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress : None
1.2 :His further gait herein; in that the levies, : None
1.2 :The lists and full proportions, are all made : None
1.2 :Out of his subject: and we here dispatch : None
1.2 :You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand, : None
1.2 :For bearers of this greeting to old Norway; : None
1.2 :Giving to you no further personal power : None
1.2 :To business with the king, more than the scope : None

1.2 :You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes? : None
1.2 :You cannot speak of reason to the Dane, : None
1.2 :And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes, : None
1.2 :That shall not be my offer, not thy asking? : None
1.2 :The head is not more native to the heart, : None
1.2 :The hand more instrumental to the mouth, : None
1.2 :Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father. : None
1.2 :What wouldst thou have, Laertes? : None
LAERTES
1.2 :My dread lord, : None
1.2 :Your leave and favour to return to France; : None
1.2 :From whence though willingly I came to Denmark, : None
1.2 :To show my duty in your coronation, : None

1.2 :My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France : None
1.2 :And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon. : None
KING CLAUDIUS
1.2 :Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius? : None
LORD POLONIUS
1.2 :He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave : None
1.2 :By laboursome petition, and at last : None
1.2 :Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent: : None
1.2 :I do beseech you, give him leave to go. : None
KING CLAUDIUS
1.2 :Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine, : None

1.2 :And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark. : None
1.2 :Do not for ever with thy vailed lids : None
1.2 :Seek for thy noble father in the dust: : None
1.2 :Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die, : None
1.2 :Passing through nature to eternity. : None
HAMLET
1.2 :Ay, madam, it is common. : None
QUEEN GERTRUDE
1.2 :If it be, : None
1.2 :Why seems it so particular with thee? : None
HAMLET
1.2 :Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.' : None
1.2 :'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, : None
1.2 :Nor customary suits of solemn black, : None
1.2 :Nor windy suspiration of forced breath, : None
1.2 :No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, : None
1.2 :Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage, : None
1.2 :Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief, : None
1.2 :That can denote me truly: these indeed seem, : None
1.2 :For they are actions that a man might play: : None
1.2 :But I have that within which passeth show; : None
1.2 :These but the trappings and the suits of woe. : None
KING CLAUDIUS
1.2 :'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet, : None
1.2 :To give these mourning duties to your father: : None
1.2 :But, you must know, your father lost a father; : None
1.2 :That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound : None
1.2 :In filial obligation for some term : None
1.2 :To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever : None
1.2 :In obstinate condolement is a course : None
1.2 :Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief; : None
1.2 :It shows a will most incorrect to heaven, : None
1.2 :A heart unfortified, a mind impatient, : None
1.2 :An understanding simple and unschool'd: : None
1.2 :For what we know must be and is as common : None
1.2 :As any the most vulgar thing to sense, : None
1.2 :Why should we in our peevish opposition : None
1.2 :Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven, : None
1.2 :A fault against the dead, a fault to nature, : None
1.2 :To reason most absurd: whose common theme : None
1.2 :Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried, : None
1.2 :From the first corse till he that died to-day, : None
1.2 :'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth : None
1.2 :This unprevailing woe, and think of us : None
1.2 :As of a father: for let the world take note, : None
1.2 :You are the most immediate to our throne; : None
1.2 :And with no less nobility of love : None
1.2 :Than that which dearest father bears his son, : None
1.2 :Do I impart toward you. For your intent : None
1.2 :In going back to school in Wittenberg, : None
1.2 :It is most retrograde to our desire: : None
1.2 :And we beseech you, bend you to remain : None
1.2 :Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye, : None

HAMLET
1.2 :I shall in all my best obey you, madam. : None
KING CLAUDIUS
1.2 :Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply: : None
1.2 :Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come; : None
1.2 :This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet : None
1.2 :Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof, : None
1.2 :No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day, : None
1.2 :But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell, : None
1.2 :And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again, : None
1.2 :Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away. : None
Exeunt all but HAMLET : ["Exeunt - ['ALL', 'HAMLET']"] : KING CLAUDIUS
HAMLET
1.2 :O, that this too too solid flesh would melt : None
1.2 :Thaw and resolve itself into a dew! : None
1.2 :Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd : None
1.2 :His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God! : None

1.2 :Seem to me all the uses of this world! : None
1.2 :Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden, : None
1.2 :That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature : None
1.2 :Possess it merely. That it should come to this! : None
1.2 :But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two: : None
1.2 :So excellent a king; that was, to this, : None
1.2 :Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother : None
1.2 :That he might not beteem the winds of heaven : None
1.2 :Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth! : None
1.2 :Must I remember? why, she would hang on him, : None
1.2 :As if increase of appetite had grown : None
1.2 :By what it fed on: and yet, within a month-- : None
1.2 :Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!-- : None
1.2 :A little month, or ere those shoes were old : None
1.2 :With which she follow'd my poor father's body, : None
1.2 :Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she-- : None
1.2 :O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason, : None
1.2 :Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle, : None
1.2 :My father's brother, but no more like my father : None
1.2 :Than I to Hercules: within a month: : None
1.2 :Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears : None
1.2 :Had left the flushing in her galled eyes, : None
1.2 :She married. O, most wicked speed, to post : None
1.2 :With such dexterity to incestuous sheets! : None
1.2 :It is not nor it cannot come to good: : None
1.2 :But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue. : None

HAMLET
2.2 :Then I would you were so honest a man. : None
LORD POLONIUS
2.2 :Honest, my lord! : None
HAMLET
2.2 :Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be : None

LORD POLONIUS

HAMLET

2.2 :though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet : None
2.2 :I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for : None

2.2 :In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she : None

ROSENCRANTZ
2.2 :None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest. : None
HAMLET
2.2 :Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true. : None
2.2 :Let me question more in particular: what have you, : None
2.2 :my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune, : None
2.2 :that she sends you to prison hither? : None
GUILDENSTERN
2.2 :Prison, my lord! : None
HAMLET
2.2 :Denmark's a prison. : None
ROSENCRANTZ
2.2 :Then is the world one. : None
HAMLET
2.2 :A goodly one; in which there are many confines, : None
2.2 :wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst. : None
ROSENCRANTZ
2.2 :We think not so, my lord. : None
HAMLET
2.2 :Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing : None
2.2 :either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me : None
2.2 :it is a prison. : None
ROSENCRANTZ
2.2 :Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too : None
2.2 :narrow for your mind. : None
HAMLET
2.2 :O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count : None
2.2 :myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I : None
2.2 :have bad dreams. : None
GUILDENSTERN
2.2 :Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very : None
2.2 :substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream. : None
HAMLET
2.2 :A dream itself is but a shadow. : None
ROSENCRANTZ
2.2 :Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a : None
2.2 :quality that it is but a shadow's shadow. : None
HAMLET
2.2 :Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and : None

ROSENCRANTZ
GUILDENSTERN
2.2 :We'll wait upon you. : None
HAMLET
2.2 :No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest : None
2.2 :of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest : None
2.2 :man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the : None
2.2 :beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore? : None
ROSENCRANTZ
2.2 :To visit you, my lord; no other occasion. : None
HAMLET
2.2 :Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I : None
2.2 :thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are : None
2.2 :too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it : None
2.2 :your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, : None
2.2 :deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak. : None
GUILDENSTERN
2.2 :What should we say, my lord? : None
HAMLET
2.2 :Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent : None
2.2 :for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks : None
2.2 :which your modesties have not craft enough to colour: : None
2.2 :I know the good king and queen have sent for you. : None
ROSENCRANTZ
2.2 :To what end, my lord? : None
HAMLET
2.2 :That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by : None
2.2 :the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of : None
2.2 :our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved : None
2.2 :love, and by what more dear a better proposer could : None

ROSENCRANTZ
2.2 :  What say you? : Aside to GUILDENSTERN : ["Aside - ['GUILDENSTERN']"] : ROSENCRANTZ

2.2 :love me, hold not off. : None
GUILDENSTERN
2.2 :My lord, we were sent for. : None
HAMLET
2.2 :I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation : None
2.2 :prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king : None
2.2 :and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but : None
2.2 :wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all : None
2.2 :custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily : None
2.2 :with my disposition that this goodly frame, the : None
2.2 :earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most : None
2.2 :excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave : None
2.2 :o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted : None
2.2 :with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to : None
2.2 :me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours. : None
2.2 :What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason! : None
2.2 :how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how : None
2.2 :express and admirable! in action how like an angel! : None
2.2 :in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the : None
2.2 :world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me, : None
2.2 :what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not : None
2.2 :me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling : None
2.2 :you seem to say so. : None
ROSENCRANTZ
2.2 :My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts. : None
HAMLET
2.2 :Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'? : None
ROSENCRANTZ
2.2 :To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what : None
2.2 :lenten entertainment the players shall receive from : None
2.2 :you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they : None
2.2 :coming, to offer you service. : None
HAMLET
2.2 :He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty : None
2.2 :shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight : None
2.2 :shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not : None
2.2 :sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part : None
2.2 :in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose : None
2.2 :lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall : None
2.2 :say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt : None
2.2 :for't. What players are they? : None
ROSENCRANTZ
2.2 :Even those you were wont to take delight in, the : None
2.2 :tragedians of the city. : None
HAMLET
2.2 :How chances it they travel? their residence, both : None
2.2 :in reputation and profit, was better both ways. : None
ROSENCRANTZ
2.2 :I think their inhibition comes by the means of the : None
2.2 :late innovation. : None
HAMLET
2.2 :Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was : None
2.2 :in the city? are they so followed? : None
ROSENCRANTZ
2.2 :No, indeed, are they not. : None
HAMLET
2.2 :How comes it? do they grow rusty? : None
ROSENCRANTZ
2.2 :Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but : None
2.2 :there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases, : None
2.2 :that cry out on the top of question, and are most : None
2.2 :tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the : None
2.2 :fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they : None
2.2 :call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of : None
2.2 :goose-quills and dare scarce come thither. : None
HAMLET
2.2 :What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are : None
2.2 :they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no : None
2.2 :longer than they can sing? will they not say : None
2.2 :afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common : None
2.2 :players--as it is most like, if their means are no : None
2.2 :better--their writers do them wrong, to make them : None
2.2 :exclaim against their own succession? : None
ROSENCRANTZ
2.2 :'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and : None
2.2 :the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to : None
2.2 :controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid : None

2.2 :Do the boys carry it away? : None
ROSENCRANTZ
2.2 :Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too. : None
HAMLET
2.2 :It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of : None

2.2 :What speech, my lord? : None
HAMLET
2.2 :I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was : None
2.2 :never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the : None
2.2 :play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas : None

2.2 :it, and others, whose judgments in such matters : None
2.2 :cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well : None
2.2 :digested in the scenes, set down with as much : None

Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters : ['None - []', 'enter - []'] : HAMLET
Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen  embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes  show of protestation unto him. He takes her up,  and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down  upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep,  leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his  crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's  ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King  dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner,  with some two or three Mutes, comes in again,  seeming to lament with her. The dead body is  carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with  gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love : ['Enter - []', 'to - []', 'None - []', 'exit - []', 'None - []', 'to - []', 'None - []', 'None - []'] : HAMLET

KING CLAUDIUS
4.7 :O, for two special reasons; : None
4.7 :Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd, : None

4.7 :She's so conjunctive to my life and soul, : None

5.1 :his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers, : None
5.1 :his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and : None
5.1 :the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine : None
5.1 :pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him : None
5.1 :no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than : None
5.1 :the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The : None

5.1 :this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha? : None
HORATIO
5.1 :Not a jot more, my lord. : None
HAMLET
5.1 :Is not parchment made of sheepskins? : None
HORATIO
5.1 :Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too. : None
HAMLET

5.1 :Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of : None
5.1 :it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the : None
5.1 :peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he : None

5.1 :grave-maker? : None
FIRST CLOWN
5.1 :Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day : None
5.1 :that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras. : None
HAMLET
5.1 :How long is that since? : None
FIRST CLOWN
5.1 :Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it : None
5.1 :was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that : None
5.1 :is mad, and sent into England. : None
HAMLET
5.1 :Ay, marry, why was he sent into England? : None
FIRST CLOWN
5.1 :Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits : None
5.1 :there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there. : None
HAMLET

5.1 :or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year. : None
HAMLET
5.1 :Why he more than another? : None
FIRST CLOWN
5.1 :Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that : None

HAMLET
5.1 :Nay, I know not. : None
FIRST CLOWN
5.1 :A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a : None

5.1 :sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester. : None
HAMLET

5.1 :Let me see. : None
Takes the skull : ['None - []'] : HAMLET
5.1 :Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow : None

5.1 :borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how : None
5.1 :abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at : None
5.1 :it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know : None
5.1 :not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your : None
5.1 :gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, : None
5.1 :that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one : None

5.2 :You do remember all the circumstance? : None
HORATIO
5.2 :Remember it, my lord? : None
HAMLET
5.2 :Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting, : None
5.2 :That would not let me sleep: methought I lay : None
5.2 :Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly, : None
5.2 :And praised be rashness for it, let us know, : None
5.2 :Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well, : None
5.2 :When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us : None
5.2 :There's a divinity that shapes our ends, : None
5.2 :Rough-hew them how we will,-- : None
HORATIO
5.2 :That is most certain. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :Up from my cabin, : None
5.2 :My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark : None
5.2 :Groped I to find out them; had my desire. : None
5.2 :Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew : None
5.2 :To mine own room again; making so bold, : None
5.2 :My fears forgetting manners, to unseal : None
5.2 :Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,-- : None
5.2 :O royal knavery!--an exact command, : None
5.2 :Larded with many several sorts of reasons : None
5.2 :Importing Denmark's health and England's too, : None
5.2 :With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life, : None
5.2 :That, on the supervise, no leisure bated, : None
5.2 :No, not to stay the grinding of the axe, : None
5.2 :My head should be struck off. : None
HORATIO
5.2 :Is't possible? : None
HAMLET
5.2 :Here's the commission: read it at more leisure. : None
5.2 :But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed? : None
HORATIO
5.2 :I beseech you. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :Being thus be-netted round with villanies,-- : None
5.2 :Ere I could make a prologue to my brains, : None
5.2 :They had begun the play--I sat me down, : None
5.2 :Devised a new commission, wrote it fair: : None
5.2 :I once did hold it, as our statists do, : None
5.2 :A baseness to write fair and labour'd much : None
5.2 :How to forget that learning, but, sir, now : None
5.2 :It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know : None
5.2 :The effect of what I wrote? : None
HORATIO
5.2 :Ay, good my lord. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :An earnest conjuration from the king, : None
5.2 :As England was his faithful tributary, : None
5.2 :As love between them like the palm might flourish, : None
5.2 :As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear : None
5.2 :And stand a comma 'tween their amities, : None
5.2 :And many such-like 'As'es of great charge, : None
5.2 :That, on the view and knowing of these contents, : None
5.2 :Without debatement further, more or less, : None
5.2 :He should the bearers put to sudden death, : None
5.2 :Not shriving-time allow'd. : None
HORATIO
5.2 :How was this seal'd? : None
HAMLET
5.2 :Why, even in that was heaven ordinant. : None
5.2 :I had my father's signet in my purse, : None
5.2 :Which was the model of that Danish seal; : None
5.2 :Folded the writ up in form of the other, : None
5.2 :Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely, : None
5.2 :The changeling never known. Now, the next day : None
5.2 :Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent : None
5.2 :Thou know'st already. : None
HORATIO
5.2 :So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :Why, man, they did make love to this employment; : None
5.2 :They are not near my conscience; their defeat : None
5.2 :Does by their own insinuation grow: : None
5.2 :'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes : None
5.2 :Between the pass and fell incensed points : None
5.2 :Of mighty opposites. : None
HORATIO
5.2 :Why, what a king is this! : None
HAMLET
5.2 :Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon-- : None
5.2 :He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother, : None
5.2 :Popp'd in between the election and my hopes, : None
5.2 :Thrown out his angle for my proper life, : None
5.2 :And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience, : None
5.2 :To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd, : None
5.2 :To let this canker of our nature come : None
5.2 :In further evil? : None
HORATIO
5.2 :It must be shortly known to him from England : None
5.2 :What is the issue of the business there. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :It will be short: the interim is mine; : None
5.2 :And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.' : None
5.2 :But I am very sorry, good Horatio, : None
5.2 :That to Laertes I forgot myself; : None
5.2 :For, by the image of my cause, I see : None
5.2 :The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours. : None
5.2 :But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me : None
5.2 :Into a towering passion. : None
HORATIO
5.2 :Peace! who comes here? : None
Enter OSRIC : ["Enter - ['OSRIC']"] : HORATIO
OSRIC
5.2 :Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly? : None
HORATIO
5.2 :No, my good lord. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to : None
5.2 :know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a : None
5.2 :beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at : None
5.2 :the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say, : None
5.2 :spacious in the possession of dirt. : None
OSRIC
5.2 :Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I : None
5.2 :should impart a thing to you from his majesty. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of : None
5.2 :spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head. : None
OSRIC
5.2 :I thank your lordship, it is very hot. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is : None
5.2 :northerly. : None
OSRIC
5.2 :It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my : None
5.2 :complexion. : None
OSRIC
5.2 :Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as : None
5.2 :'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his : None
5.2 :majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a : None
5.2 :great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,-- : None
HAMLET
5.2 :I beseech you, remember-- : None
HAMLET moves him to put on his hat : ["to - ['HAMLET']"] : HAMLET
OSRIC
5.2 :Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith. : None
5.2 :Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe : None
5.2 :me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent : None
5.2 :differences, of very soft society and great showing: : None
5.2 :indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or : None
5.2 :calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the : None
5.2 :continent of what part a gentleman would see. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you; : None
5.2 :though, I know, to divide him inventorially would : None
5.2 :dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw : None
5.2 :neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the : None
5.2 :verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of : None
5.2 :great article; and his infusion of such dearth and : None
5.2 :rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his : None
5.2 :semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace : None
5.2 :him, his umbrage, nothing more. : None
OSRIC
5.2 :Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman : None
5.2 :in our more rawer breath? : None
OSRIC
5.2 :Sir? : None
HORATIO
5.2 :Is't not possible to understand in another tongue? : None
5.2 :You will do't, sir, really. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :What imports the nomination of this gentleman? : None
OSRIC
5.2 :Of Laertes? : None
HORATIO
5.2 :His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :Of him, sir. : None
OSRIC
5.2 :I know you are not ignorant-- : None
HAMLET
5.2 :I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did, : None
5.2 :it would not much approve me. Well, sir? : None
OSRIC
5.2 :You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is-- : None
HAMLET
5.2 :I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with : None
5.2 :him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to : None
5.2 :know himself. : None
OSRIC
5.2 :I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation : None
5.2 :laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :What's his weapon? : None
OSRIC
5.2 :Rapier and dagger. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :That's two of his weapons: but, well. : None
OSRIC
5.2 :The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary : None
5.2 :horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take : None
5.2 :it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their : None
5.2 :assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the : None
5.2 :carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very : None
5.2 :responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages, : None
5.2 :and of very liberal conceit. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :What call you the carriages? : None
HORATIO
5.2 :I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done. : None
OSRIC
5.2 :The carriages, sir, are the hangers. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we : None
5.2 :could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might : None
5.2 :be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses : None
5.2 :against six French swords, their assigns, and three : None
5.2 :liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet : None
5.2 :against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it? : None
OSRIC
5.2 :The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes : None
5.2 :between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you : None
5.2 :three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it : None
5.2 :would come to immediate trial, if your lordship : None
5.2 :would vouchsafe the answer. : None
HAMLET
5.2 :How if I answer 'no'? : None
OSRIC
