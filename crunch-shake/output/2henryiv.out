LORD BARDOLPH
1.1 :Who keeps the gate here, ho? : None
The Porter opens the gate : ["None - ['PORTER']"] : LORD BARDOLPH
1.1 :Where is the earl? : None
PORTER
1.1 :What shall I say you are? : None
LORD BARDOLPH
1.1 :Tell thou the earl : None
1.1 :That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here. : None
PORTER
1.1 :His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard; : None
1.1 :Please it your honour, knock but at the gate, : None
1.1 :And he himself wilt answer. : None
Enter NORTHUMBERLAND : ["Enter - ['NORTHUMBERLAND']"] : PORTER
LORD BARDOLPH
1.1 :Here comes the earl. : None
Exit Porter : ["Exit - ['PORTER']"] : LORD BARDOLPH
NORTHUMBERLAND
1.1 :What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now : None
1.1 :Should be the father of some stratagem: : None
1.1 :The times are wild: contention, like a horse : None
1.1 :Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose : None
1.1 :And bears down all before him. : None
LORD BARDOLPH
1.1 :Noble earl, : None
1.1 :I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury. : None
NORTHUMBERLAND
1.1 :Good, an God will! : None
LORD BARDOLPH
1.1 :                  As good as heart can wish: : None
1.1 :The king is almost wounded to the death; : None
1.1 :And, in the fortune of my lord your son, : None
1.1 :Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts : None
1.1 :Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John : None
1.1 :And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field; : None
1.1 :And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John, : None
1.1 :Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day, : None
1.1 :So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won, : None
1.1 :Came not till now to dignify the times, : None
1.1 :Since Caesar's fortunes! : None
NORTHUMBERLAND
1.1 :How is this derived? : None
1.1 :Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury? : None
LORD BARDOLPH
1.1 :I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence, : None
1.1 :A gentleman well bred and of good name, : None
1.1 :That freely render'd me these news for true. : None
NORTHUMBERLAND
1.1 :Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent : None
1.1 :On Tuesday last to listen after news. : None
Enter TRAVERS : ["Enter - ['TRAVERS']"] : NORTHUMBERLAND
LORD BARDOLPH
1.1 :My lord, I over-rode him on the way; : None
1.1 :And he is furnish'd with no certainties : None
1.1 :More than he haply may retail from me. : None
NORTHUMBERLAND
1.1 :Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you? : None
TRAVERS
1.1 :My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back : None
1.1 :With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed, : None
1.1 :Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard : None
1.1 :A gentleman, almost forspent with speed, : None
1.1 :That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse. : None
1.1 :He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him : None
1.1 :I did demand what news from Shrewsbury: : None
1.1 :He told me that rebellion had bad luck : None
1.1 :And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold. : None
1.1 :With that, he gave his able horse the head, : None
1.1 :And bending forward struck his armed heels : None
1.1 :Against the panting sides of his poor jade : None
1.1 :Up to the rowel-head, and starting so : None
1.1 :He seem'd in running to devour the way, : None
1.1 :Staying no longer question. : None
NORTHUMBERLAND
1.1 :Ha! Again: : None
1.1 :Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold? : None
1.1 :Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion : None
1.1 :Had met ill luck? : None
LORD BARDOLPH
1.1 :                  My lord, I'll tell you what; : None
1.1 :If my young lord your son have not the day, : None
1.1 :Upon mine honour, for a silken point : None
1.1 :I'll give my barony: never talk of it. : None
NORTHUMBERLAND
1.1 :Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers : None
1.1 :Give then such instances of loss? : None
LORD BARDOLPH
1.1 :Who, he? : None
1.1 :He was some hilding fellow that had stolen : None
1.1 :The horse he rode on, and, upon my life, : None
1.1 :Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news. : None
Enter MORTON : ["Enter - ['MORTON']"] : LORD BARDOLPH
NORTHUMBERLAND
1.1 :Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf, : None
1.1 :Foretells the nature of a tragic volume: : None
1.1 :So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood : None
1.1 :Hath left a witness'd usurpation. : None
1.1 :Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury? : None
MORTON
1.1 :I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord; : None
1.1 :Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask : None
1.1 :To fright our party. : None
NORTHUMBERLAND
1.1 :How doth my son and brother? : None
1.1 :Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek : None
1.1 :Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand. : None
1.1 :Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless, : None
1.1 :So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone, : None
1.1 :Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night, : None
1.1 :And would have told him half his Troy was burnt; : None
1.1 :But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue, : None
1.1 :And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it. : None
1.1 :This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus; : None
1.1 :Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:' : None
1.1 :Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds: : None
1.1 :But in the end, to stop my ear indeed, : None
1.1 :Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise, : None
1.1 :Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.' : None
MORTON
1.1 :Douglas is living, and your brother, yet; : None
1.1 :But, for my lord your son-- : None
NORTHUMBERLAND
1.1 :Why, he is dead. : None
1.1 :See what a ready tongue suspicion hath! : None
1.1 :He that but fears the thing he would not know : None
1.1 :Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes : None
1.1 :That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton; : None
1.1 :Tell thou an earl his divination lies, : None
1.1 :And I will take it as a sweet disgrace : None
1.1 :And make thee rich for doing me such wrong. : None
MORTON
1.1 :You are too great to be by me gainsaid: : None
1.1 :Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain. : None
NORTHUMBERLAND
1.1 :Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead. : None
1.1 :I see a strange confession in thine eye: : None
1.1 :Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin : None
1.1 :To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so; : None
1.1 :The tongue offends not that reports his death: : None
1.1 :And he doth sin that doth belie the dead, : None
1.1 :Not he which says the dead is not alive. : None
1.1 :Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news : None
1.1 :Hath but a losing office, and his tongue : None
1.1 :Sounds ever after as a sullen bell, : None
1.1 :Remember'd tolling a departing friend. : None
LORD BARDOLPH
1.1 :I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead. : None
MORTON
1.1 :I am sorry I should force you to believe : None
1.1 :That which I would to God I had not seen; : None
1.1 :But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state, : None
1.1 :Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed, : None
1.1 :To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down : None
1.1 :The never-daunted Percy to the earth, : None
1.1 :From whence with life he never more sprung up. : None
1.1 :In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire : None
1.1 :Even to the dullest peasant in his camp, : None
1.1 :Being bruited once, took fire and heat away : None
1.1 :From the best temper'd courage in his troops; : None
1.1 :For from his metal was his party steel'd; : None
1.1 :Which once in him abated, all the rest : None
1.1 :Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead: : None
1.1 :And as the thing that's heavy in itself, : None
1.1 :Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed, : None
1.1 :So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss, : None
1.1 :Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear : None
1.1 :That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim : None
1.1 :Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety, : None
1.1 :Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester : None
1.1 :Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot, : None
1.1 :The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword : None
1.1 :Had three times slain the appearance of the king, : None
1.1 :'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame : None
1.1 :Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight, : None
1.1 :Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all : None
1.1 :Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out : None
1.1 :A speedy power to encounter you, my lord, : None
1.1 :Under the conduct of young Lancaster : None
1.1 :And Westmoreland. This is the news at full. : None
NORTHUMBERLAND
1.1 :For this I shall have time enough to mourn. : None
1.1 :In poison there is physic; and these news, : None
1.1 :Having been well, that would have made me sick, : None
1.1 :Being sick, have in some measure made me well: : None
1.1 :And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints, : None
1.1 :Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life, : None
1.1 :Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire : None
1.1 :Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs, : None
1.1 :Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief, : None
1.1 :Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch! : None
1.1 :A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel : None
1.1 :Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif! : None
1.1 :Thou art a guard too wanton for the head : None
1.1 :Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit. : None
1.1 :Now bind my brows with iron; and approach : None
1.1 :The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring : None
1.1 :To frown upon the enraged Northumberland! : None
1.1 :Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand : None
1.1 :Keep the wild flood confined! let order die! : None
1.1 :And let this world no longer be a stage : None
1.1 :To feed contention in a lingering act; : None
1.1 :But let one spirit of the first-born Cain : None
1.1 :Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set : None
1.1 :On bloody courses, the rude scene may end, : None
1.1 :And darkness be the burier of the dead! : None
TRAVERS
1.1 :This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord. : None
LORD BARDOLPH
1.1 :Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour. : None
MORTON
1.1 :The lives of all your loving complices : None
1.1 :Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er : None
1.1 :To stormy passion, must perforce decay. : None
1.1 :You cast the event of war, my noble lord, : None
1.1 :And summ'd the account of chance, before you said : None
1.1 :'Let us make head.' It was your presurmise, : None
1.1 :That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop: : None
1.1 :You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge, : None
1.1 :More likely to fall in than to get o'er; : None
1.1 :You were advised his flesh was capable : None
1.1 :Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit : None
1.1 :Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged: : None
1.1 :Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this, : None
1.1 :Though strongly apprehended, could restrain : None
1.1 :The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen, : None
1.1 :Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth, : None
1.1 :More than that being which was like to be? : None
LORD BARDOLPH
1.1 :We all that are engaged to this loss : None
1.1 :Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas : None
1.1 :That if we wrought our life 'twas ten to one; : None
1.1 :And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed : None
1.1 :Choked the respect of likely peril fear'd; : None
1.1 :And since we are o'erset, venture again. : None
1.1 :Come, we will all put forth, body and goods. : None
MORTON
1.1 :'Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord, : None
1.1 :I hear for certain, and do speak the truth, : None
1.1 :The gentle Archbishop of York is up : None
1.1 :With well-appointed powers: he is a man : None
1.1 :Who with a double surety binds his followers. : None
1.1 :My lord your son had only but the corpse, : None
1.1 :But shadows and the shows of men, to fight; : None
1.1 :For that same word, rebellion, did divide : None
1.1 :The action of their bodies from their souls; : None
1.1 :And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd, : None
1.1 :As men drink potions, that their weapons only : None
1.1 :Seem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls, : None
1.1 :This word, rebellion, it had froze them up, : None
1.1 :As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop : None
1.1 :Turns insurrection to religion: : None
1.1 :Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts, : None
1.1 :He's followed both with body and with mind; : None
1.1 :And doth enlarge his rising with the blood : None
1.1 :Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones; : None
1.1 :Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause; : None
1.1 :Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land, : None
1.1 :Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke; : None
1.1 :And more and less do flock to follow him. : None
NORTHUMBERLAND
1.1 :I knew of this before; but, to speak truth, : None
1.1 :This present grief had wiped it from my mind. : None
1.1 :Go in with me; and counsel every man : None
1.1 :The aptest way for safety and revenge: : None
1.1 :Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed: : None
1.1 :Never so few, and never yet more need. : None

Scene(scene=2)
Enter FALSTAFF, with his Page bearing his sword and buckler : ["Enter - ['FALSTAFF', 'PAGE']"] : NORTHUMBERLAND
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water? : None
PAGE
1.2 :He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy : None
1.2 :water; but, for the party that owed it, he might : None
1.2 :have more diseases than he knew for. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the : None
1.2 :brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not : None
1.2 :able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more : None
1.2 :than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only : None
1.2 :witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other : None
1.2 :men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that : None
1.2 :hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the : None
1.2 :prince put thee into my service for any other reason : None
1.2 :than to set me off, why then I have no judgment. : None
1.2 :Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn : None
1.2 :in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never : None
1.2 :manned with an agate till now: but I will inset you : None
1.2 :neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and : None
1.2 :send you back again to your master, for a jewel,-- : None
1.2 :the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is : None
1.2 :not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in : None
1.2 :the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his : None
1.2 :cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is : None
1.2 :a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tis : None
1.2 :not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a : None
1.2 :face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence : None
1.2 :out of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had : None
1.2 :writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He : None
1.2 :may keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine, : None
1.2 :I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about : None
1.2 :the satin for my short cloak and my slops? : None
PAGE
1.2 :He said, sir, you should procure him better : None
1.2 :assurance than Bardolph: he would not take his : None
1.2 :band and yours; he liked not the security. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Let him be damned, like the glutton! pray God his : None
1.2 :tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascally : None
1.2 :yea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand, : None
1.2 :and then stand upon security! The whoreson : None
1.2 :smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and : None
1.2 :bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is : None
1.2 :through with them in honest taking up, then they : None
1.2 :must stand upon security. I had as lief they would : None
1.2 :put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with : None
1.2 :security. I looked a' should have sent me two and : None
1.2 :twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he : None
1.2 :sends me security. Well, he may sleep in security; : None
1.2 :for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness : None
1.2 :of his wife shines through it: and yet cannot he : None
1.2 :see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him. : None
1.2 :Where's Bardolph? : None
PAGE
1.2 :He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in : None
1.2 :Smithfield: an I could get me but a wife in the : None
1.2 :stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived. : None
Enter the Lord Chief-Justice and Servant : ["Enter - ['SERVANT']"] : FALSTAFF
PAGE
1.2 :Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the : None
1.2 :Prince for striking him about Bardolph. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Wait, close; I will not see him. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	What's he that goes there? : None
SERVANT
1.2 :Falstaff, an't please your lordship. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	He that was in question for the robbery? : None
SERVANT
1.2 :He, my lord: but he hath since done good service at : None
1.2 :Shrewsbury; and, as I hear, is now going with some : None
1.2 :charge to the Lord John of Lancaster. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	What, to York? Call him back again. : None
SERVANT
1.2 :Sir John Falstaff! : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Boy, tell him I am deaf. : None
PAGE
1.2 :You must speak louder; my master is deaf. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good. : None
1.2 :Go, pluck him by the elbow; I must speak with him. : None
SERVANT
1.2 :Sir John! : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :What! a young knave, and begging! Is there not : None
1.2 :wars? is there not employment? doth not the king : None
1.2 :lack subjects? do not the rebels need soldiers? : None
1.2 :Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it : None
1.2 :is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side, : None
1.2 :were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell : None
1.2 :how to make it. : None
SERVANT
1.2 :You mistake me, sir. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? setting : None
1.2 :my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied : None
1.2 :in my throat, if I had said so. : None
SERVANT
1.2 :I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and our : None
1.2 :soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you, : None
1.2 :you lie in your throat, if you say I am any other : None
1.2 :than an honest man. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside that : None
1.2 :which grows to me! if thou gettest any leave of me, : None
1.2 :hang me; if thou takest leave, thou wert better be : None
1.2 :hanged. You hunt counter: hence! avaunt! : None
SERVANT
1.2 :Sir, my lord would speak with you. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John Falstaff, a word with you. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :My good lord! God give your lordship good time of : None
1.2 :day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard : None
1.2 :say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship : None
1.2 :goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not : None
1.2 :clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in : None
1.2 :you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must : None
1.2 :humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care : None
1.2 :of your health. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to : None
1.2 :Shrewsbury. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is : None
1.2 :returned with some discomfort from Wales. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when : None
1.2 :I sent for you. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into : None
1.2 :this same whoreson apoplexy. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with : None
1.2 :you. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy, : None
1.2 :an't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the : None
1.2 :blood, a whoreson tingling. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	What tell you me of it? be it as it is. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :It hath its original from much grief, from study and : None
1.2 :perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of : None
1.2 :his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	I think you are fallen into the disease; for you : None
1.2 :hear not what I say to you. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an't please : None
1.2 :you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady : None
1.2 :of not marking, that I am troubled withal. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	To punish you by the heels would amend the : None
1.2 :attention of your ears; and I care not if I do : None
1.2 :become your physician. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient: : None
1.2 :your lordship may minister the potion of : None
1.2 :imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how : None
1.2 :should I be your patient to follow your : None
1.2 :prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a : None
1.2 :scruple, or indeed a scruple itself. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	I sent for you, when there were matters against you : None
1.2 :for your life, to come speak with me. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the : None
1.2 :laws of this land-service, I did not come. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	Your means are very slender, and your waste is great. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :I would it were otherwise; I would my means were : None
1.2 :greater, and my waist slenderer. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	You have misled the youthful prince. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow : None
1.2 :with the great belly, and he my dog. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your : None
1.2 :day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded : None
1.2 :over your night's exploit on Gad's-hill: you may : None
1.2 :thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting : None
1.2 :that action. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :My lord? : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a : None
1.2 :sleeping wolf. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt : None
1.2 :out. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say : None
1.2 :of wax, my growth would approve the truth. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	There is not a white hair on your face but should : None
1.2 :have his effect of gravity. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	You follow the young prince up and down, like his : None
1.2 :ill angel. : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope : None
1.2 :he that looks upon me will take me without weighing: : None
1.2 :and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I : None
1.2 :cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these : None
1.2 :costermonger times that true valour is turned : None
1.2 :bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath : None
1.2 :his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the : None
1.2 :other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of : None
1.2 :this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry. : None
1.2 :You that are old consider not the capacities of us : None

1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth, : None

1.2 :yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an : None
1.2 :increasing belly? is not your voice broken? your : None
1.2 :wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and : None

1.2 :will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John! : None
FALSTAFF
1.2 :My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the : None
1.2 :afternoon, with a white head and something a round : None
1.2 :belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing : None
1.2 :and singing of anthems. To approve my youth : None
1.2 :further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in : None
1.2 :judgment and understanding; and he that will caper : None
1.2 :with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the : None
1.2 :money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that : None
1.2 :the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince, : None
1.2 :and you took it like a sensible lord. I have : None
1.2 :chequed him for it, and the young lion repents; : None
1.2 :marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk : None
1.2 :and old sack. : None
1.2 :Lord Chief-Justice	Well, God send the prince a better companion! : None

FALSTAFF
1.2 :Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look : None
1.2 :you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home, : None
1.2 :that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the : None
1.2 :Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean : None
1.2 :not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day, : None
1.2 :and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I : None
1.2 :might never spit white again. There is not a : None
1.2 :dangerous action can peep out his head but I am : None
1.2 :thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it : None
1.2 :was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if : None
1.2 :they have a good thing, to make it too common. If : None
1.2 :ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give : None
1.2 :me rest. I would to God my name were not so : None
1.2 :terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be : None

Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the Lords HASTINGS, MOWBRAY, and BARDOLPH : ["Enter - ['ARCHBISHOP OF YORK', 'HASTINGS', 'MOWBRAY', 'BARDOLPH']"] : FALSTAFF
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
1.3 :Thus have you heard our cause and known our means; : None
1.3 :And, my most noble friends, I pray you all, : None
1.3 :Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes: : None
1.3 :And first, lord marshal, what say you to it? : None
MOWBRAY
1.3 :I well allow the occasion of our arms; : None
1.3 :But gladly would be better satisfied : None
1.3 :How in our means we should advance ourselves : None
1.3 :To look with forehead bold and big enough : None
1.3 :Upon the power and puissance of the king. : None
HASTINGS
1.3 :Our present musters grow upon the file : None
1.3 :To five and twenty thousand men of choice; : None
1.3 :And our supplies live largely in the hope : None
1.3 :Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns : None
1.3 :With an incensed fire of injuries. : None
LORD BARDOLPH
1.3 :The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus; : None
1.3 :Whether our present five and twenty thousand : None
1.3 :May hold up head without Northumberland? : None
HASTINGS
1.3 :With him, we may. : None
LORD BARDOLPH
1.3 :                  Yea, marry, there's the point: : None
1.3 :But if without him we be thought too feeble, : None
1.3 :My judgment is, we should not step too far : None
1.3 :Till we had his assistance by the hand; : None
1.3 :For in a theme so bloody-faced as this : None
1.3 :Conjecture, expectation, and surmise : None
1.3 :Of aids incertain should not be admitted. : None
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
1.3 :'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed : None
1.3 :It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury. : None
LORD BARDOLPH
1.3 :It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope, : None
1.3 :Eating the air on promise of supply, : None
1.3 :Flattering himself in project of a power : None
1.3 :Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts: : None
1.3 :And so, with great imagination : None
1.3 :Proper to madmen, led his powers to death : None
1.3 :And winking leap'd into destruction. : None
HASTINGS
1.3 :But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt : None
1.3 :To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope. : None
LORD BARDOLPH
1.3 :Yes, if this present quality of war, : None
1.3 :Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot : None
1.3 :Lives so in hope as in an early spring : None
1.3 :We see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit, : None
1.3 :Hope gives not so much warrant as despair : None
1.3 :That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build, : None
1.3 :We first survey the plot, then draw the model; : None
1.3 :And when we see the figure of the house, : None
1.3 :Then must we rate the cost of the erection; : None
1.3 :Which if we find outweighs ability, : None
1.3 :What do we then but draw anew the model : None
1.3 :In fewer offices, or at last desist : None
1.3 :To build at all? Much more, in this great work, : None
1.3 :Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down : None
1.3 :And set another up, should we survey : None
1.3 :The plot of situation and the model, : None
1.3 :Consent upon a sure foundation, : None
1.3 :Question surveyors, know our own estate, : None
1.3 :How able such a work to undergo, : None
1.3 :To weigh against his opposite; or else : None
1.3 :We fortify in paper and in figures, : None
1.3 :Using the names of men instead of men: : None
1.3 :Like one that draws the model of a house : None
1.3 :Beyond his power to build it; who, half through, : None
1.3 :Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost : None
1.3 :A naked subject to the weeping clouds : None
1.3 :And waste for churlish winter's tyranny. : None
HASTINGS
1.3 :Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth, : None
1.3 :Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd : None
1.3 :The utmost man of expectation, : None

1.3 :Even as we are, to equal with the king. : None
LORD BARDOLPH
1.3 :What, is the king but five and twenty thousand? : None
HASTINGS
1.3 :To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph. : None
1.3 :For his divisions, as the times do brawl, : None
1.3 :Are in three heads: one power against the French, : None
1.3 :And one against Glendower; perforce a third : None
1.3 :Must take up us: so is the unfirm king : None
1.3 :In three divided; and his coffers sound : None
1.3 :With hollow poverty and emptiness. : None
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
1.3 :That he should draw his several strengths together : None
1.3 :And come against us in full puissance, : None
1.3 :Need not be dreaded. : None
HASTINGS
1.3 :If he should do so, : None
1.3 :He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh : None
1.3 :Baying him at the heels: never fear that. : None
LORD BARDOLPH
1.3 :Who is it like should lead his forces hither? : None
HASTINGS
1.3 :The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland; : None
1.3 :Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth: : None
1.3 :But who is substituted 'gainst the French, : None
1.3 :I have no certain notice. : None
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
1.3 :Let us on, : None
1.3 :And publish the occasion of our arms. : None
1.3 :The commonwealth is sick of their own choice; : None
1.3 :Their over-greedy love hath surfeited: : None
1.3 :An habitation giddy and unsure : None
1.3 :Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart. : None
1.3 :O thou fond many, with what loud applause : None
1.3 :Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke, : None
1.3 :Before he was what thou wouldst have him be! : None
1.3 :And being now trimm'd in thine own desires, : None
1.3 :Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him, : None
1.3 :That thou provokest thyself to cast him up. : None
1.3 :So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge : None
1.3 :Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard; : None
1.3 :And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up, : None
1.3 :And howl'st to find it. What trust is in : None
1.3 :these times? : None
1.3 :They that, when Richard lived, would have him die, : None
1.3 :Are now become enamour'd on his grave: : None
1.3 :Thou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly head : None
1.3 :When through proud London he came sighing on : None
1.3 :After the admired heels of Bolingbroke, : None
1.3 :Criest now 'O earth, yield us that king again, : None
1.3 :And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accursed! : None
1.3 :Past and to come seems best; things present worst. : None

2.1 :Alas the day! take heed of him; he stabbed me in : None

PRINCE HENRY
2.2 :Before God, I am exceeding weary. : None
POINS
2.2 :Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not : None
2.2 :have attached one of so high blood. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.2 :Faith, it does me; though it discolours the : None
2.2 :complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth : None
2.2 :it not show vilely in me to desire small beer? : None
POINS
2.2 :Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as : None
2.2 :to remember so weak a composition. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.2 :Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for, : None
2.2 :by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature, : None
2.2 :small beer. But, indeed, these humble : None
2.2 :considerations make me out of love with my : None
2.2 :greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember : None
2.2 :thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to : None
2.2 :take note how many pair of silk stockings thou : None
2.2 :hast, viz. these, and those that were thy : None
2.2 :peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy : None
2.2 :shirts, as, one for superfluity, and another for : None
2.2 :use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better : None
2.2 :than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when : None
2.2 :thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done : None
2.2 :a great while, because the rest of thy low : None
2.2 :countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland: : None
2.2 :and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins : None
2.2 :of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the : None

2.2 :mightily strengthened. : None
POINS
2.2 :How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard, : None
2.2 :you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good : None

PRINCE HENRY
2.2 :Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins? : None
POINS
2.2 :Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing. : None

PRINCE HENRY

PRINCE HENRY
2.2 :By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's : None

2.2 :hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow. : None
POINS
2.2 :The reason? : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.2 :What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep? : None
POINS
2.2 :I would think thee a most princely hypocrite. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.2 :It would be every man's thought; and thou art a : None
2.2 :blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never : None
2.2 :a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way : None
2.2 :better than thine: every man would think me an : None
2.2 :hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most : None
2.2 :worshipful thought to think so? : None
POINS
2.2 :Why, because you have been so lewd and so much : None
2.2 :engraffed to Falstaff. : None
PRINCE HENRY
2.2 :And to thee. : None
POINS
2.2 :By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it : None

SHALLOW
3.2 :By yea and nay, sir, I dare say my cousin William is : None

SILENCE
3.2 :Indeed, sir, to my cost. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :A' must, then, to the inns o' court shortly. I was : None

3.2 :talk of mad Shallow yet. : None
SILENCE
3.2 :You were called 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin. : None

3.2 :have done any thing indeed too, and roundly too. : None
3.2 :There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire, : None
3.2 :and black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and : None
3.2 :Will Squele, a Cotswold man; you had not four such : None
3.2 :swinge-bucklers in all the inns o' court again: and : None

3.2 :crack not thus high: and the very same day did I : None
3.2 :fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer, : None
3.2 :behind Gray's Inn. Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that I : None

SILENCE
3.2 :Dead, sir. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :Jesu, Jesu, dead! a' drew a good bow; and dead! a' : None
3.2 :shot a fine shoot: John a Gaunt loved him well, and : None
3.2 :betted much money on his head. Dead! a' would have : None
3.2 :clapped i' the clout at twelve score; and carried : None
3.2 :you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a : None
3.2 :half, that it would have done a man's heart good to : None
3.2 :see. How a score of ewes now? : None

3.2 :county, and one of the king's justices of th e peace: : None

3.2 :man. How doth the good knight? may I ask how my : None
3.2 :lady his wife doth? : None
BARDOLPH
3.2 :Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated than : None
3.2 :with a wife. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said : None
3.2 :indeed too. Better accommodated! it is good; yea, : None
3.2 :indeed, is it: good phrases are surely, and ever : None
3.2 :were, very commendable. Accommodated! it comes of : None
3.2 :'accommodo' very good; a good phrase. : None
BARDOLPH
3.2 :Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word. Phrase call : None
3.2 :you it? by this good day, I know not the phrase; : None
3.2 :but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a : None
3.2 :soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good : None
3.2 :command, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when a : None
3.2 :man is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is, : None
3.2 :being, whereby a' may be thought to be accommodated; : None
3.2 :which is an excellent thing. : None

FALSTAFF
3.2 :Is thy name Mouldy? : None
MOULDY
3.2 :Yea, an't please you. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :'Tis the more time thou wert used. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith! Things that : None
3.2 :are mouldy lack use: very singular good! in faith, : None
3.2 :well said, Sir John, very well said. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Prick him. : None
MOULDY
3.2 :I was pricked well enough before, an you could have : None
3.2 :let me alone: my old dame will be undone now for : None
3.2 :one to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you need : None
3.2 :not to have pricked me; there are other men fitter : None
3.2 :to go out than I. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Go to: peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it is : None
3.2 :time you were spent. : None
MOULDY
3.2 :Spent! : None

3.2 :you are? For the other, Sir John: let me see: : None

SHALLOW
3.2 :Where's Shadow? : None
SHADOW
3.2 :Here, sir. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Shadow, whose son art thou? : None
SHADOW
3.2 :My mother's son, sir. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Thy mother's son! like enough, and thy father's : None
3.2 :shadow: so the son of the female is the shadow of : None
3.2 :the male: it is often so, indeed; but much of the : None
3.2 :father's substance! : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :Do you like him, Sir John? : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Shadow will serve for summer; prick him, for we have : None
3.2 :a number of shadows to fill up the muster-book. : None

FALSTAFF
3.2 :Thou art a very ragged wart. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :Shall I prick him down, Sir John? : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :It were superfluous; for his apparel is built upon : None
3.2 :his back and the whole frame stands upon pins: : None
3.2 :prick him no more. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :Ha, ha, ha! you can do it, sir; you can do it: I : None

FEEBLE
3.2 :A woman's tailor, sir. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :Shall I prick him, sir? : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :You may: but if he had been a man's tailor, he'ld : None
3.2 :ha' pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes in : None
3.2 :an enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat? : None
FEEBLE
3.2 :I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Well said, good woman's tailor! well said, : None
3.2 :courageous Feeble! thou wilt be as valiant as the : None
3.2 :wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the : None
3.2 :woman's tailor: well, Master Shallow; deep, Master Shallow. : None
FEEBLE
3.2 :I would Wart might have gone, sir. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst : None
3.2 :mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him : None
3.2 :to a private soldier that is the leader of so many : None
3.2 :thousands: let that suffice, most forcible Feeble. : None
FEEBLE
3.2 :It shall suffice, sir. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is next? : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :Peter Bullcalf o' the green! : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Yea, marry, let's see Bullcalf. : None
BULLCALF
3.2 :Here, sir. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :'Fore God, a likely fellow! Come, prick me Bullcalf : None
3.2 :till he roar again. : None
BULLCALF
3.2 :O Lord! good my lord captain,-- : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :What, dost thou roar before thou art pricked? : None
BULLCALF
3.2 :O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :What disease hast thou? : None
BULLCALF
3.2 :A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught : None
3.2 :with ringing in the king's affairs upon his : None
3.2 :coronation-day, sir. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown; we wilt : None
3.2 :have away thy cold; and I will take such order that : None
3.2 :my friends shall ring for thee. Is here all? : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :Here is two more called than your number, you must : None
3.2 :have but four here, sir: and so, I pray you, go in : None
3.2 :with me to dinner. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry : None
3.2 :dinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night : None
3.2 :in the windmill in Saint George's field? : None
FALSTAFF

FALSTAFF
3.2 :She lives, Master Shallow. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :She never could away with me. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Never, never; she would always say she could not : None
3.2 :abide Master Shallow. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :By the mass, I could anger her to the heart. She : None
3.2 :was then a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well? : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Old, old, Master Shallow. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old; : None

SILENCE
3.2 :That's fifty-five year ago. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that : None
3.2 :this knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well? : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith, : None
3.2 :Sir John, we have: our watch-word was 'Hem boys!' : None

BULLCALF
3.2 :Good Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my friend; : None
3.2 :and here's four Harry ten shillings in French crowns : None
3.2 :for you. In very truth, sir, I had as lief be : None
3.2 :hanged, sir, as go: and yet, for mine own part, sir, : None
3.2 :I do not care; but rather, because I am unwilling, : None
3.2 :and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay with : None
3.2 :my friends; else, sir, I did not care, for mine own : None
3.2 :part, so much. : None
BARDOLPH
3.2 :Go to; stand aside. : None
MOULDY
3.2 :And, good master corporal captain, for my old : None
3.2 :dame's sake, stand my friend: she has nobody to do : None
3.2 :any thing about her when I am gone; and she is old, : None
3.2 :and cannot help herself: You shall have forty, sir. : None
BARDOLPH
3.2 :Go to; stand aside. : None
FEEBLE
3.2 :By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once: we : None
3.2 :owe God a death: I'll ne'er bear a base mind: : None
3.2 :an't be my destiny, so; an't be not, so: no man is : None
3.2 :too good to serve's prince; and let it go which way : None
3.2 :it will, he that dies this year is quit for the next. : None
BARDOLPH
3.2 :Well said; thou'rt a good fellow. : None
FEEBLE
3.2 :Faith, I'll bear no base mind. : None

BARDOLPH
3.2 :Sir, a word with you: I have three pound to free : None

FALSTAFF
3.2 :Go to; well. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :Come, Sir John, which four will you have? : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Do you choose for me. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :Marry, then, Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble and Shadow. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Mouldy and Bullcalf: for you, Mouldy, stay at home : None
3.2 :till you are past service: and for your part, : None
3.2 :Bullcalf, grow till you come unto it: I will none of you. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong: they are : None
3.2 :your likeliest men, and I would have you served with the best. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a : None
3.2 :man? Care I for the limb, the thewes, the stature, : None
3.2 :bulk, and big assemblance of a man! Give me the : None
3.2 :spirit, Master Shallow. Here's Wart; you see what a : None
3.2 :ragged appearance it is; a' shall charge you and : None
3.2 :discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's : None
3.2 :hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets : None
3.2 :on the brewer's bucket. And this same half-faced : None
3.2 :fellow, Shadow; give me this man: he presents no : None
3.2 :mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim : None
3.2 :level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat; : None
3.2 :how swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor run : None
3.2 :off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the : None
3.2 :great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart's hand, Bardolph. : None
BARDOLPH
3.2 :Hold, Wart, traverse; thus, thus, thus. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Come, manage me your caliver. So: very well: go : None
3.2 :to: very good, exceeding good. O, give me always a : None
3.2 :little, lean, old, chapt, bald shot. Well said, i' : None
3.2 :faith, Wart; thou'rt a good scab: hold, there's a : None
3.2 :tester for thee. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :He is not his craft's master; he doth not do it : None
3.2 :right. I remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay at : None
3.2 :Clement's Inn--I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's : None
3.2 :show,--there was a little quiver fellow, and a' : None
3.2 :would manage you his piece thus; and a' would about : None
3.2 :and about, and come you in and come you in: 'rah, : None
3.2 :tah, tah,' would a' say; 'bounce' would a' say; and : None
3.2 :away again would a' go, and again would a' come: I : None
3.2 :shall ne'er see such a fellow. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :These fellows will do well, Master Shallow. God : None
3.2 :keep you, Master Silence: I will not use many words : None
3.2 :with you. Fare you well, gentlemen both: I thank : None
3.2 :you: I must a dozen mile to-night. Bardolph, give : None
3.2 :the soldiers coats. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :Sir John, the Lord bless you! God prosper your : None
3.2 :affairs! God send us peace! At your return visit : None
3.2 :our house; let our old acquaintance be renewed; : None
3.2 :peradventure I will with ye to the court. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :'Fore God, I would you would, Master Shallow. : None
SHALLOW
3.2 :Go to; I have spoke at a word. God keep you. : None
FALSTAFF
3.2 :Fare you well, gentle gentlemen. : None
Exeunt Justices : ['Exeunt - []'] : FALSTAFF
3.2 :On, Bardolph; lead the men away. : None
Exeunt BARDOLPH, Recruits,  & c : ["Exeunt - ['BARDOLPH']"] : FALSTAFF
3.2 :As I return, I will fetch off these justices: I do : None
3.2 :see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how : None
3.2 :subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This : None
3.2 :same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to : None
3.2 :me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he : None
3.2 :hath done about Turnbull Street: and every third : None
3.2 :word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's : None
3.2 :tribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a : None
3.2 :man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a' : None
3.2 :was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked : None
3.2 :radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it : None
3.2 :with a knife: a' was so forlorn, that his : None
3.2 :dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a' : None
3.2 :was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a : None
3.2 :monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' came : None
3.2 :ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those : None
3.2 :tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the : None
3.2 :carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or : None
3.2 :his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger : None
3.2 :become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a : None
3.2 :Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and : None
3.2 :I'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in the : None
3.2 :Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding : None
3.2 :among the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a : None
3.2 :Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have : None
3.2 :thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the : None
3.2 :case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a : None
3.2 :court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll : None
3.2 :be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall : None
3.2 :go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two : None
3.2 :stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the : None
3.2 :old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I : None
3.2 :may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end. : None

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
4.1 :Wherefore do I this? so the question stands. : None
4.1 :Briefly to this end: we are all diseased, : None
4.1 :And with our surfeiting and wanton hours : None
4.1 :Have brought ourselves into a burning fever, : None
4.1 :And we must bleed for it; of which disease : None
4.1 :Our late king, Richard, being infected, died. : None
4.1 :But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland, : None
4.1 :I take not on me here as a physician, : None
4.1 :Nor do I as an enemy to peace : None
4.1 :Troop in the throngs of military men; : None
4.1 :But rather show awhile like fearful war, : None

4.1 :And purge the obstructions which begin to stop : None
4.1 :Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly. : None
4.1 :I have in equal balance justly weigh'd : None
4.1 :What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer, : None
4.1 :And find our griefs heavier than our offences. : None
4.1 :We see which way the stream of time doth run, : None
4.1 :And are enforced from our most quiet there : None
4.1 :By the rough torrent of occasion; : None
4.1 :And have the summary of all our griefs, : None
4.1 :When time shall serve, to show in articles; : None

4.1 :And you shall say indeed, it is the time, : None
4.1 :And not the king, that doth you injuries. : None
4.1 :Yet for your part, it not appears to me : None

4.1 :The king that loved him, as the state stood then, : None

4.1 :Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd : None
4.1 :My father from the breast of Bolingbroke, : None
4.1 :O when the king did throw his warder down, : None

4.1 :That he will give you audience; and wherein : None
4.1 :It shall appear that your demands are just, : None
4.1 :You shall enjoy them, every thing set off : None
4.1 :That might so much as think you enemies. : None
MOWBRAY
4.1 :But he hath forced us to compel this offer; : None
4.1 :And it proceeds from policy, not love. : None
WESTMORELAND
4.1 :Mowbray, you overween to take it so; : None
4.1 :This offer comes from mercy, not from fear: : None
4.1 :For, lo! within a ken our army lies, : None
4.1 :Upon mine honour, all too confident : None

4.1 :Our battle is more full of names than yours, : None
4.1 :Our men more perfect in the use of arms, : None
4.1 :Our armour all as strong, our cause the best; : None
4.1 :Then reason will our heart should be as good : None

MOWBRAY

4.1 :As our conditions shall consist upon, : None
4.1 :Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains. : None
MOWBRAY
4.1 :Yea, but our valuation shall be such : None

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
4.1 :No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary : None
4.1 :Of dainty and such picking grievances: : None
4.1 :For he hath found to end one doubt by death : None
4.1 :Revives two greater in the heirs of life, : None
4.1 :And therefore will he wipe his tables clean : None
4.1 :And keep no tell-tale to his memory : None
4.1 :That may repeat and history his loss : None
4.1 :To new remembrance; for full well he knows : None
4.1 :He cannot so precisely weed this land : None
4.1 :As his misdoubts present occasion: : None
4.1 :His foes are so enrooted with his friends : None
4.1 :That, plucking to unfix an enemy, : None

4.1 :That was uprear'd to execution. : None
HASTINGS
4.1 :Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods : None
4.1 :On late offenders, that he now doth lack : None
4.1 :The very instruments of chastisement: : None
4.1 :So that his power, like to a fangless lion, : None

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
4.1 :'Tis very true: : None

4.3 :I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than : None
4.3 :your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober- : None
4.3 :blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make : None
4.3 :him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine. : None
4.3 :There's never none of these demure boys come to any : None
4.3 :proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood, : None
4.3 :and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a : None
4.3 :kind of male green-sickness; and then when they : None
4.3 :marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools : None
4.3 :and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for : None
4.3 :inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold : None
4.3 :operation in it. It ascends me into the brain; : None
4.3 :dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy : None
4.3 :vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive, : None
4.3 :quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and : None
4.3 :delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the : None
4.3 :voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes : None
4.3 :excellent wit. The second property of your : None
4.3 :excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood; : None
4.3 :which, before cold and settled, left the liver : None
4.3 :white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity : None
4.3 :and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes : None
4.3 :it course from the inwards to the parts extreme: : None
4.3 :it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives : None
4.3 :warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, : None
4.3 :man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and : None
4.3 :inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain, : None
4.3 :the heart, who, great and puffed up with this : None
4.3 :retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour : None
4.3 :comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is : None
4.3 :nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and : None
4.3 :learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till : None
4.3 :sack commences it and sets it in act and use. : None
4.3 :Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for : None

4.3 :manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent : None
4.3 :endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile : None
4.3 :sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If : None

4.4 :His temper, therefore, must be well observed: : None
4.4 :Chide him for faults, and do it reverently, : None

DAVY
5.1 :Marry, sir, thus; those precepts cannot be served: : None
5.1 :and, again, sir, shall we sow the headland with wheat? : None
SHALLOW
5.1 :With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook: are : None

DAVY
5.1 :Yes, sir. Here is now the smith's note for shoeing : None

5.1 :Hinckley fair? : None
SHALLOW
5.1 :A' shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a couple : None

5.1 :pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William cook. : None
DAVY
5.1 :Doth the man of war stay all night, sir? : None
SHALLOW
5.1 :Yea, Davy. I will use him well: a friend i' the : None
5.1 :court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men : None
5.1 :well, Davy; for they are arrant knaves, and will backbite. : None
DAVY
5.1 :No worse than they are backbitten, sir; for they : None

SHALLOW
5.1 :Well conceited, Davy: about thy business, Davy. : None
DAVY
5.1 :I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor of : None

SHALLOW
5.1 :There is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor: : None
5.1 :that Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge. : None
DAVY
5.1 :I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but : None
5.1 :yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some : None
5.1 :countenance at his friend's request. An honest : None
5.1 :man, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave : None
5.1 :is not. I have served your worship truly, sir, : None
5.1 :this eight years; and if I cannot once or twice in : None
5.1 :a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I : None
5.1 :have but a very little credit with your worship. The : None
5.1 :knave is mine honest friend, sir; therefore, I : None

5.1 :semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his: : None
5.1 :they, by observing of him, do bear themselves like : None
5.1 :foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is : None
5.1 :turned into a justice-like serving-man: their : None
5.1 :spirits are so married in conjunction with the : None
5.1 :participation of society that they flock together in : None
5.1 :consent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suit : None
5.1 :to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the : None
5.1 :imputation of being near their master: if to his : None
5.1 :men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man : None
5.1 :could better command his servants. It is certain : None
5.1 :that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is : None
5.1 :caught, as men take diseases, one of another: : None
5.1 :therefore let men take heed of their company. I : None

5.1 :keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing : None
5.1 :out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two : None
5.1 :actions, and a' shall laugh without intervallums. O, : None

5.2 :The immediate heir of England! Was this easy? : None
5.2 :May this be wash'd in Lethe, and forgotten? : None

5.5 :First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech. : None
5.5 :My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty; : None
5.5 :and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look : None
5.5 :for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have : None
5.5 :to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I : None
5.5 :should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring. : None
5.5 :But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it : None
5.5 :known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here : None
5.5 :in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your : None
5.5 :patience for it and to promise you a better. I : None
5.5 :meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an : None
5.5 :ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and : None
5.5 :you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you : None
5.5 :I would be and here I commit my body to your : None
5.5 :mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and, : None
5.5 :as most debtors do, promise you infinitely. : None
5.5 :If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will : None
5.5 :you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but : None
5.5 :light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a : None
5.5 :good conscience will make any possible satisfaction, : None
5.5 :and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have : None
5.5 :forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the : None
5.5 :gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which : None
5.5 :was never seen before in such an assembly. : None
5.5 :One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too : None
5.5 :much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will : None
5.5 :continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make : None
5.5 :you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for : None
5.5 :any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat, : None
5.5 :unless already a' be killed with your hard : None
5.5 :opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is : None
5.5 :not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are : None
5.5 :too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down : None
5.5 :before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen. : None
