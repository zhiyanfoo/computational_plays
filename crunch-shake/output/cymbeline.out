SECOND GENTLEMAN

FIRST GENTLEMAN

SECOND GENTLEMAN

1.1 :So slackly guarded, and the search so slow, : None
1.1 :That could not trace them! : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN

FIRST LORD
1.2 :Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the : None

1.2 :sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in: : None
1.2 :there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent. : None
CLOTEN
1.2 :If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him? : None
SECOND LORD
1.2 :  No, 'faith; not so much as his patience. : Aside : ['Aside - []'] : SECOND LORD
FIRST LORD
1.2 :Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be : None
1.2 :not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt. : None
SECOND LORD
1.2 :  His steel was in debt; it went o' the : Aside : ['Aside - []'] : SECOND LORD
1.2 :backside the town. : None
CLOTEN
1.2 :The villain would not stand me. : None
SECOND LORD
1.2 :  No; but he fled forward still, toward your face. : Aside : ['Aside - []'] : SECOND LORD

SECOND LORD
1.2 :  She shines not upon fools, lest the : Aside : ['Aside - []'] : SECOND LORD
1.2 :reflection should hurt her. : None
CLOTEN
1.2 :Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some : None

1.3 :And question'dst every sail: if he should write : None
1.3 :And not have it, 'twere a paper lost, : None
1.3 :As offer'd mercy is. What was the last : None
1.3 :That he spake to thee? : None
PISANIO
1.3 :It was his queen, his queen! : None
IMOGEN
1.3 :Then waved his handkerchief? : None
PISANIO

IMOGEN
1.3 :I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but : None
1.3 :To look upon him, till the diminution : None
1.3 :Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle, : None
1.3 :Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from : None
1.3 :The smallness of a gnat to air, and then : None

Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a Dutchman, and a Spaniard : ["Enter - ['PHILARIO', 'IACHIMO', 'FRENCHMAN']"] : PISANIO
IACHIMO
1.4 :Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was : None
1.4 :then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy : None
1.4 :as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I : None
1.4 :could then have looked on him without the help of : None
1.4 :admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments : None
1.4 :had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items. : None
PHILARIO
1.4 :You speak of him when he was less furnished than now : None
1.4 :he is with that which makes him both without and within. : None
FRENCHMAN
1.4 :I have seen him in France: we had very many there : None
1.4 :could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he. : None
IACHIMO
1.4 :This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein : None
1.4 :he must be weighed rather by her value than his own, : None
1.4 :words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter. : None
FRENCHMAN
1.4 :And then his banishment. : None
IACHIMO
1.4 :Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this : None
1.4 :lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully : None
1.4 :to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment, : None
1.4 :which else an easy battery might lay flat, for : None
1.4 :taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes : None
1.4 :it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps : None
1.4 :acquaintance? : None
PHILARIO
1.4 :His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I : None
1.4 :have been often bound for no less than my life. : None
1.4 :Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained : None
1.4 :amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your : None
1.4 :knowing, to a stranger of his quality. : None
Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS : ["Enter - ['POSTHUMUS LEONATUS']"] : PHILARIO
1.4 :I beseech you all, be better known to this : None
1.4 :gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend : None
1.4 :of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear : None
1.4 :hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing. : None
FRENCHMAN
1.4 :Sir, we have known together in Orleans. : None
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
1.4 :Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies, : None
1.4 :which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still. : None
FRENCHMAN
1.4 :Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I : None
1.4 :did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity : None
1.4 :you should have been put together with so mortal a : None
1.4 :purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so : None
1.4 :slight and trivial a nature. : None
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
1.4 :By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller; : None
1.4 :rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in : None
1.4 :my every action to be guided by others' experiences: : None
1.4 :but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say : None
1.4 :it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight. : None
FRENCHMAN
1.4 :'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords, : None
1.4 :and by such two that would by all likelihood have : None
1.4 :confounded one the other, or have fallen both. : None
IACHIMO
1.4 :Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference? : None
FRENCHMAN
1.4 :Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public, : None
1.4 :which may, without contradiction, suffer the report. : None
1.4 :It was much like an argument that fell out last : None
1.4 :night, where each of us fell in praise of our : None
1.4 :country mistresses; this gentleman at that time : None
1.4 :vouching--and upon warrant of bloody : None
1.4 :affirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise, : None
1.4 :chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable : None
1.4 :than any the rarest of our ladies in France. : None
IACHIMO
1.4 :That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's : None
1.4 :opinion by this worn out. : None
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
1.4 :She holds her virtue still and I my mind. : None
IACHIMO
1.4 :You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy. : None
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
1.4 :Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would : None
1.4 :abate her nothing, though I profess myself her : None
1.4 :adorer, not her friend. : None
IACHIMO
1.4 :As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand : None
1.4 :comparison--had been something too fair and too good : None
1.4 :for any lady in Britain. If she went before others : None
1.4 :I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres : None
1.4 :many I have beheld. I could not but believe she : None
1.4 :excelled many: but I have not seen the most : None
1.4 :precious diamond that is, nor you the lady. : None
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
1.4 :I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone. : None
IACHIMO
1.4 :What do you esteem it at? : None
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
1.4 :More than the world enjoys. : None
IACHIMO
1.4 :Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's : None

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
1.4 :No, no. : None
IACHIMO
1.4 :I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to : None
1.4 :your ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it : None

IACHIMO
1.4 :You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy : None

GUIDERIUS
3.3 :Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged, : None

3.3 :If quiet life be best; sweeter to you : None

3.3 :Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage : None

BELARIUS
3.3 :How you speak! : None
3.3 :Did you but know the city's usuries : None

PISANIO
3.4 :Not so, neither: : None
3.4 :But if I were as wise as honest, then : None

PISANIO

IMOGEN
3.4 :Why good fellow, : None
3.4 :What shall I do the where? where bide? how live? : None

PISANIO
3.4 :If not at court, : None
3.4 :Then not in Britain must you bide. : None
IMOGEN
3.4 :Where then : None
3.4 :Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night, : None
3.4 :Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume : None
3.4 :Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't; : None

3.4 :There's livers out of Britain. : None
PISANIO
3.4 :I am most glad : None

3.4 :To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind : None
3.4 :Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise : None
3.4 :That which, to appear itself, must not yet be : None

IMOGEN
3.4 :O, for such means! : None
3.4 :Though peril to my modesty, not death on't, : None
3.4 :I would adventure. : None
PISANIO
3.4 :Well, then, here's the point: : None
3.4 :You must forget to be a woman; change : None
3.4 :Command into obedience: fear and niceness-- : None
3.4 :The handmaids of all women, or, more truly, : None
3.4 :Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage: : None
3.4 :Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and : None
3.4 :As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must : None
3.4 :Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek, : None
3.4 :Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart! : None
3.4 :Alack, no remedy!--to the greedy touch : None
3.4 :Of common-kissing Titan, and forget : None
3.4 :Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein : None
3.4 :You made great Juno angry. : None
IMOGEN
3.4 :Nay, be brief : None
3.4 :I see into thy end, and am almost : None

PISANIO
3.4 :First, make yourself but like one. : None

3.4 :A prince's courage. Away, I prithee. : None
PISANIO
3.4 :Well, madam, we must take a short farewell, : None
3.4 :Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of : None
3.4 :Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress, : None
3.4 :Here is a box; I had it from the queen: : None
3.4 :What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea, : None
3.4 :Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this : None
3.4 :Will drive away distemper. To some shade, : None
