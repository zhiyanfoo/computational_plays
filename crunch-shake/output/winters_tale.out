1.1 :difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia. : None
CAMILLO
1.1 :I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia : None

ARCHIDAMUS
1.1 :Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be : None
1.1 :justified in our loves; for indeed-- : None
CAMILLO
1.1 :Beseech you,-- : None
ARCHIDAMUS
1.1 :Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge: : None
1.1 :we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know : None
1.1 :not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks, : None

1.1 :They were trained together in their childhoods; and : None
1.1 :there rooted betwixt them then such an affection, : None
1.1 :which cannot choose but branch now. Since their : None

1.1 :with interchange of gifts, letters, loving : None

1.1 :though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and : None
1.1 :embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed : None
1.1 :winds. The heavens continue their loves! : None
ARCHIDAMUS
1.1 :I think there is not in the world either malice or : None
1.1 :matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable : None
1.1 :comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a : None
1.1 :gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came : None
1.1 :into my note. : None
CAMILLO
1.1 :I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it : None
1.1 :is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the : None
1.1 :subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on : None
1.1 :crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to : None
1.1 :see him a man. : None
ARCHIDAMUS
1.1 :Would they else be content to die? : None
CAMILLO
1.1 :Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should : None

1.2 :Of our most gracious mistress. : None
LEONTES
1.2 :Satisfy! : None
1.2 :The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy! : None

1.2 :If ever I were wilful-negligent, : None
1.2 :It was my folly; if industriously : None
1.2 :I play'd the fool, it was my negligence, : None
1.2 :Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful : None
1.2 :To do a thing, where I the issue doubted, : None
1.2 :Where of the execution did cry out : None
1.2 :Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear : None
1.2 :Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord, : None
1.2 :Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty : None
1.2 :Is never free of. But, beseech your grace, : None
1.2 :Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass : None
1.2 :By its own visage: if I then deny it, : None

1.2 :As deep as that, though true. : None
LEONTES
1.2 :Is whispering nothing? : None
1.2 :Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses? : None
1.2 :Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career : None
1.2 :Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible : None
1.2 :Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot? : None
1.2 :Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift? : None
1.2 :Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes : None
1.2 :Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only, : None
1.2 :That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing? : None
1.2 :Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing; : None

1.2 :Of this diseased opinion, and betimes; : None

1.2 :                  It is; you lie, you lie: : None
1.2 :I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee, : None
1.2 :Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave, : None
1.2 :Or else a hovering temporizer, that : None
1.2 :Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil, : None

CAMILLO
1.2 :Who does infect her? : None
LEONTES
1.2 :Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging : None

1.2 :To see alike mine honour as their profits, : None
1.2 :Their own particular thrifts, they would do that : None
1.2 :Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou, : None
1.2 :His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form : None
1.2 :Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see : None
1.2 :Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven, : None
1.2 :How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup, : None
1.2 :To give mine enemy a lasting wink; : None
1.2 :Which draught to me were cordial. : None
CAMILLO
1.2 :Sir, my lord, : None
1.2 :I could do this, and that with no rash potion, : None
1.2 :But with a lingering dram that should not work : None
1.2 :Maliciously like poison: but I cannot : None
1.2 :Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress, : None
1.2 :So sovereignly being honourable. : None
1.2 :I have loved thee,-- : None
LEONTES
1.2 :Make that thy question, and go rot! : None
1.2 :Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled, : None
1.2 :To appoint myself in this vexation, sully : None
1.2 :The purity and whiteness of my sheets, : None

1.2 :Could man so blench? : None
CAMILLO
1.2 :I must believe you, sir: : None

1.2 :Provided that, when he's removed, your highness : None
1.2 :Will take again your queen as yours at first, : None

Exit : ['Exit - []'] : LEONTES
CAMILLO
1.2 :O miserable lady! But, for me, : None
1.2 :What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner : None
1.2 :Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't : None
1.2 :Is the obedience to a master, one : None
1.2 :Who in rebellion with himself will have : None
1.2 :All that are his so too. To do this deed, : None
1.2 :Promotion follows. If I could find example : None
1.2 :Of thousands that had struck anointed kings : None
1.2 :And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since : None
1.2 :Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one, : None
1.2 :Let villany itself forswear't. I must : None
1.2 :Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain : None
1.2 :To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now! : None
1.2 :Here comes Bohemia. : None

POLIXENES
1.2 :The king hath on him such a countenance : None
1.2 :As he had lost some province and a region : None
1.2 :Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him : None
1.2 :With customary compliment; when he, : None
1.2 :Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling : None
1.2 :A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and : None
1.2 :So leaves me to consider what is breeding : None
1.2 :That changeth thus his manners. : None
CAMILLO
1.2 :I dare not know, my lord. : None
POLIXENES
1.2 :How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not? : None
1.2 :Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts; : None
1.2 :For, to yourself, what you do know, you must. : None
1.2 :And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo, : None
1.2 :Your changed complexions are to me a mirror : None
1.2 :Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be : None
1.2 :A party in this alteration, finding : None
1.2 :Myself thus alter'd with 't. : None
CAMILLO
1.2 :There is a sickness : None
1.2 :Which puts some of us in distemper, but : None
1.2 :I cannot name the disease; and it is caught : None
1.2 :Of you that yet are well. : None
POLIXENES
1.2 :How! caught of me! : None
1.2 :Make me not sighted like the basilisk: : None
1.2 :I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better : None
1.2 :By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,-- : None
1.2 :As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto : None
1.2 :Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns : None
1.2 :Our gentry than our parents' noble names, : None
1.2 :In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you, : None
1.2 :If you know aught which does behove my knowledge : None
1.2 :Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not : None
1.2 :In ignorant concealment. : None
CAMILLO
1.2 :I may not answer. : None
POLIXENES
1.2 :A sickness caught of me, and yet I well! : None
1.2 :I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo, : None
1.2 :I conjure thee, by all the parts of man : None
1.2 :Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least : None
1.2 :Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare : None

1.2 :If not, how best to bear it. : None
CAMILLO
1.2 :Sir, I will tell you; : None
1.2 :Since I am charged in honour and by him : None
1.2 :That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel, : None
1.2 :Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as : None

POLIXENES
1.2 :On, good Camillo. : None
CAMILLO
1.2 :I am appointed him to murder you. : None
POLIXENES
1.2 :By whom, Camillo? : None
CAMILLO
1.2 :                        By the king. : None
POLIXENES
1.2 :For what? : None
CAMILLO
1.2 :He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears, : None
1.2 :As he had seen't or been an instrument : None
1.2 :To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen : None
1.2 :Forbiddenly. : None
POLIXENES
1.2 :                  O, then my best blood turn : None
1.2 :To an infected jelly and my name : None
1.2 :Be yoked with his that did betray the Best! : None
1.2 :Turn then my freshest reputation to : None
1.2 :A savour that may strike the dullest nostril : None
1.2 :Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd, : None
1.2 :Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection : None
1.2 :That e'er was heard or read! : None
CAMILLO
1.2 :Swear his thought over : None
1.2 :By each particular star in heaven and : None
1.2 :By all their influences, you may as well : None
1.2 :Forbid the sea for to obey the moon : None
1.2 :As or by oath remove or counsel shake : None
1.2 :The fabric of his folly, whose foundation : None
1.2 :Is piled upon his faith and will continue : None
1.2 :The standing of his body. : None
POLIXENES
1.2 :How should this grow? : None
CAMILLO
1.2 :I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to : None

1.2 :If therefore you dare trust my honesty, : None
1.2 :That lies enclosed in this trunk which you : None
1.2 :Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night! : None
1.2 :Your followers I will whisper to the business, : None
1.2 :And will by twos and threes at several posterns : None
1.2 :Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put : None
1.2 :My fortunes to your service, which are here : None
1.2 :By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain; : None
1.2 :For, by the honour of my parents, I : None
1.2 :Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove, : None
1.2 :I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer : None
1.2 :Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon : None
1.2 :His execution sworn. : None
POLIXENES
1.2 :I do believe thee: : None
1.2 :I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand: : None
1.2 :Be pilot to me and thy places shall : None
1.2 :Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and : None
1.2 :My people did expect my hence departure : None
1.2 :Two days ago. This jealousy : None
1.2 :Is for a precious creature: as she's rare, : None
1.2 :Must it be great, and as his person's mighty, : None
1.2 :Must it be violent, and as he does conceive : None
1.2 :He is dishonour'd by a man which ever : None
1.2 :Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must : None

2.1 :Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him? : None
FIRST LORD
2.1 :Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never : None

LEONTES
2.1 :How blest am I : None
2.1 :In my just censure, in my true opinion! : None
2.1 :Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed : None
2.1 :In being so blest! There may be in the cup : None
2.1 :A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart, : None

2.1 :Is not infected: but if one present : None
2.1 :The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known : None
2.1 :How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides, : None
2.1 :With violent hefts. I have drunk, : None
2.1 :and seen the spider. : None
2.1 :Camillo was his help in this, his pander: : None
2.1 :There is a plot against my life, my crown; : None
2.1 :All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain : None

LEONTES
2.1 :Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her; : None

2.1 :Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said : None
2.1 :She's an adulteress; I have said with whom: : None
2.1 :More, she's a traitor and Camillo is : None
2.1 :A federary with her, and one that knows : None
2.1 :What she should shame to know herself : None
2.1 :But with her most vile principal, that she's : None

4.4 :I understand the business, I hear it: to have an : None

4.4 :this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive. : None
4.4 :What an exchange had this been without boot! What : None
4.4 :a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do : None
4.4 :this year connive at us, and we may do any thing : None
4.4 :extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of : None

CLOWN
4.4 :We are but plain fellows, sir. : None
AUTOLYCUS
4.4 :A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no : None

SHEPHERD
4.4 :Why, sir? : None
AUTOLYCUS

AUTOLYCUS
4.4 :If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly: : None

CLOWN
4.4 :Think you so, sir? : None

SHEPHERD
4.4 :An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for : None

4.4 :Ay, sir. : None
AUTOLYCUS
4.4 :Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business? : None
CLOWN
4.4 :In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful : None

AUTOLYCUS
4.4 :O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him, : None
4.4 :he'll be made an example. : None
CLOWN
4.4 :Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show : None

5.1 :If, one by one, you wedded all the world, : None
5.1 :Or from the all that are took something good, : None
5.1 :To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd : None
5.1 :Would be unparallel'd. : None
LEONTES
5.1 :I think so. Kill'd! : None
5.1 :She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me : None
5.1 :Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter : None
5.1 :Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now, : None
5.1 :Say so but seldom. : None
CLEOMENES
5.1 :                  Not at all, good lady: : None
5.1 :You might have spoken a thousand things that would : None
5.1 :Have done the time more benefit and graced : None
5.1 :Your kindness better. : None
PAULINA
5.1 :You are one of those : None
5.1 :Would have him wed again. : None
DION
5.1 :If you would not so, : None
5.1 :You pity not the state, nor the remembrance : None
5.1 :Of his most sovereign name; consider little : None
5.1 :What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue, : None
5.1 :May drop upon his kingdom and devour : None
5.1 :Incertain lookers on. What were more holy : None
5.1 :Than to rejoice the former queen is well? : None
5.1 :What holier than, for royalty's repair, : None
5.1 :For present comfort and for future good, : None
5.1 :To bless the bed of majesty again : None
5.1 :With a sweet fellow to't? : None
PAULINA
5.1 :There is none worthy, : None
5.1 :Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods : None
5.1 :Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes; : None
5.1 :For has not the divine Apollo said, : None
5.1 :Is't not the tenor of his oracle, : None
5.1 :That King Leontes shall not have an heir : None
5.1 :Till his lost child be found? which that it shall, : None
5.1 :Is all as monstrous to our human reason : None
5.1 :As my Antigonus to break his grave : None
5.1 :And come again to me; who, on my life, : None
5.1 :Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel : None
5.1 :My lord should to the heavens be contrary, : None
5.1 :Oppose against their wills. : None
To LEONTES : ["To - ['LEONTES']"] : PAULINA
5.1 :Care not for issue; : None
5.1 :The crown will find an heir: great Alexander : None
5.1 :Left his to the worthiest; so his successor : None
5.1 :Was like to be the best. : None
LEONTES
5.1 :Good Paulina, : None
5.1 :Who hast the memory of Hermione, : None
5.1 :I know, in honour, O, that ever I : None
5.1 :Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now, : None
5.1 :I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes, : None
5.1 :Have taken treasure from her lips-- : None
PAULINA
5.1 :And left them : None
5.1 :More rich for what they yielded. : None
LEONTES
5.1 :Thou speak'st truth. : None
5.1 :No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse, : None
5.1 :And better used, would make her sainted spirit : None
5.1 :Again possess her corpse, and on this stage, : None
5.1 :Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd, : None
5.1 :And begin, 'Why to me?' : None
PAULINA
5.1 :Had she such power, : None
5.1 :She had just cause. : None
LEONTES
5.1 :She had; and would incense me : None
5.1 :To murder her I married. : None
PAULINA
5.1 :I should so. : None
5.1 :Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark : None
5.1 :Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't : None
5.1 :You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears : None
5.1 :Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd : None
5.1 :Should be 'Remember mine.' : None
LEONTES
5.1 :Stars, stars, : None
5.1 :And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife; : None
5.1 :I'll have no wife, Paulina. : None
PAULINA
5.1 :Will you swear : None
5.1 :Never to marry but by my free leave? : None
LEONTES
5.1 :Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit! : None
PAULINA
5.1 :Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath. : None
CLEOMENES
5.1 :You tempt him over-much. : None
PAULINA
5.1 :Unless another, : None
5.1 :As like Hermione as is her picture, : None
5.1 :Affront his eye. : None
CLEOMENES
5.1 :                  Good madam,-- : None
PAULINA
5.1 :I have done. : None
5.1 :Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir, : None
5.1 :No remedy, but you will,--give me the office : None
5.1 :To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young : None
5.1 :As was your former; but she shall be such : None
5.1 :As, walk'd your first queen's ghost, : None
5.1 :it should take joy : None
5.1 :To see her in your arms. : None
LEONTES
5.1 :My true Paulina, : None
5.1 :We shall not marry till thou bid'st us. : None
PAULINA
5.1 :That : None
5.1 :Shall be when your first queen's again in breath; : None
5.1 :Never till then. : None

GENTLEMAN
5.1 :One that gives out himself Prince Florizel, : None
5.1 :Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she : None
5.1 :The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access : None
5.1 :To your high presence. : None
LEONTES
5.1 :What with him? he comes not : None
5.1 :Like to his father's greatness: his approach, : None
5.1 :So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us : None
5.1 :'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced : None
5.1 :By need and accident. What train? : None
GENTLEMAN
5.1 :But few, : None
5.1 :And those but mean. : None
LEONTES
5.1 :His princess, say you, with him? : None
GENTLEMAN
5.1 :Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think, : None
5.1 :That e'er the sun shone bright on. : None
PAULINA
5.1 :O Hermione, : None
5.1 :As every present time doth boast itself : None
5.1 :Above a better gone, so must thy grave : None
5.1 :Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself : None
5.1 :Have said and writ so, but your writing now : None
5.1 :Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been, : None
5.1 :Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse : None
5.1 :Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd, : None
5.1 :To say you have seen a better. : None
GENTLEMAN
5.1 :Pardon, madam: : None
5.1 :The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,-- : None
5.1 :The other, when she has obtain'd your eye, : None
5.1 :Will have your tongue too. This is a creature, : None
5.1 :Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal : None
5.1 :Of all professors else, make proselytes : None
5.1 :Of who she but bid follow. : None
PAULINA
5.1 :How! not women? : None
GENTLEMAN
5.1 :Women will love her, that she is a woman : None

5.1 :He thus should steal upon us. : None
PAULINA
5.1 :Had our prince, : None
5.1 :Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd : None

5.1 :Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince; : None
5.1 :For she did print your royal father off, : None
5.1 :Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one, : None
5.1 :Your father's image is so hit in you, : None
5.1 :His very air, that I should call you brother, : None
5.1 :As I did him, and speak of something wildly : None
5.1 :By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome! : None
5.1 :And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas! : None
5.1 :I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth : None
5.1 :Might thus have stood begetting wonder as : None
5.1 :You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost-- : None
5.1 :All mine own folly--the society, : None
5.1 :Amity too, of your brave father, whom, : None
5.1 :Though bearing misery, I desire my life : None
5.1 :Once more to look on him. : None
FLORIZEL
5.1 :By his command : None
5.1 :Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him : None
5.1 :Give you all greetings that a king, at friend, : None
5.1 :Can send his brother: and, but infirmity : None
5.1 :Which waits upon worn times hath something seized : None
5.1 :His wish'd ability, he had himself : None
5.1 :The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his : None
5.1 :Measured to look upon you; whom he loves-- : None
5.1 :He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres : None
5.1 :And those that bear them living. : None
LEONTES
5.1 :O my brother, : None
5.1 :Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir : None
5.1 :Afresh within me, and these thy offices, : None
5.1 :So rarely kind, are as interpreters : None
5.1 :Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither, : None
5.1 :As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too : None
5.1 :Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage, : None
5.1 :At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune, : None
5.1 :To greet a man not worth her pains, much less : None
5.1 :The adventure of her person? : None
FLORIZEL
5.1 :Good my lord, : None
5.1 :She came from Libya. : None
LEONTES
5.1 :Where the warlike Smalus, : None
5.1 :That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved? : None
FLORIZEL
5.1 :Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter : None
5.1 :His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence, : None
5.1 :A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd, : None
5.1 :To execute the charge my father gave me : None
5.1 :For visiting your highness: my best train : None
5.1 :I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd; : None
5.1 :Who for Bohemia bend, to signify : None
5.1 :Not only my success in Libya, sir, : None
5.1 :But my arrival and my wife's in safety : None
5.1 :Here where we are. : None
LEONTES
5.1 :                  The blessed gods : None
5.1 :Purge all infection from our air whilst you : None
5.1 :Do climate here! You have a holy father, : None
5.1 :A graceful gentleman; against whose person, : None
5.1 :So sacred as it is, I have done sin: : None
5.1 :For which the heavens, taking angry note, : None
5.1 :Have left me issueless; and your father's blest, : None
5.1 :As he from heaven merits it, with you : None

Enter a Lord : ["Enter - ['LORD']"] : LEONTES
LORD
5.1 :Most noble sir, : None
5.1 :That which I shall report will bear no credit, : None
5.1 :Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir, : None
5.1 :Bohemia greets you from himself by me; : None
5.1 :Desires you to attach his son, who has-- : None
5.1 :His dignity and duty both cast off-- : None
5.1 :Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with : None
5.1 :A shepherd's daughter. : None
LEONTES
5.1 :Where's Bohemia? speak. : None
LORD
5.1 :Here in your city; I now came from him: : None
5.1 :I speak amazedly; and it becomes : None
5.1 :My marvel and my message. To your court : None

5.1 :Of this fair couple, meets he on the way : None

FLORIZEL
5.1 :Camillo has betray'd me; : None

LEONTES
5.1 :Who? Camillo? : None
LORD
5.1 :Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now : None
5.1 :Has these poor men in question. Never saw I : None
5.1 :Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth; : None
5.1 :Forswear themselves as often as they speak: : None
5.1 :Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them : None

PERDITA
5.1 :O my poor father! : None
5.1 :The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have : None
5.1 :Our contract celebrated. : None
LEONTES
5.1 :You are married? : None
FLORIZEL
5.1 :We are not, sir, nor are we like to be; : None
5.1 :The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first: : None

LEONTES
5.1 :My lord, : None
5.1 :Is this the daughter of a king? : None
FLORIZEL
5.1 :She is, : None
5.1 :When once she is my wife. : None
LEONTES
5.1 :That 'once' I see by your good father's speed : None
5.1 :Will come on very slowly. I am sorry, : None
5.1 :Most sorry, you have broken from his liking : None
5.1 :Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry : None
5.1 :Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty, : None
5.1 :That you might well enjoy her. : None
FLORIZEL
5.1 :Dear, look up: : None
5.1 :Though Fortune, visible an enemy, : None
5.1 :Should chase us with my father, power no jot : None
5.1 :Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir, : None
5.1 :Remember since you owed no more to time : None
5.1 :Than I do now: with thought of such affections, : None
5.1 :Step forth mine advocate; at your request : None
5.1 :My father will grant precious things as trifles. : None

To FLORIZEL : ["To - ['FLORIZEL']"] : LEONTES

Scene(scene=2)
Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman : ["Enter - ['AUTOLYCUS', 'GENTLEMAN']"] : LEONTES
AUTOLYCUS
5.2 :Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation? : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
5.2 :I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old : None
5.2 :shepherd deliver the manner how he found it: : None
5.2 :whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all : None
5.2 :commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I : None
5.2 :heard the shepherd say, he found the child. : None
AUTOLYCUS
5.2 :I would most gladly know the issue of it. : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
5.2 :I make a broken delivery of the business; but the : None
5.2 :changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were : None
5.2 :very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with : None
5.2 :staring on one another, to tear the cases of their : None
5.2 :eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language : None
5.2 :in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard : None
5.2 :of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable : None
5.2 :passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest : None
5.2 :beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not : None
5.2 :say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the : None
5.2 :extremity of the one, it must needs be. : None
Enter another Gentleman : ["Enter - ['GENTLEMAN']"] : FIRST GENTLEMAN
5.2 :Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more. : None
5.2 :The news, Rogero? : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN
5.2 :Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the : None
5.2 :king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is : None
5.2 :broken out within this hour that ballad-makers : None
5.2 :cannot be able to express it. : None
Enter a third Gentleman : ["Enter - ['THIRD GENTLEMAN']"] : SECOND GENTLEMAN
5.2 :Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can : None
5.2 :deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news : None
5.2 :which is called true is so like an old tale, that : None
5.2 :the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king : None
5.2 :found his heir? : None
THIRD GENTLEMAN
5.2 :Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by : None
5.2 :circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you : None
5.2 :see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle : None
5.2 :of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it, : None
5.2 :the letters of Antigonus found with it which they : None
5.2 :know to be his character, the majesty of the : None
5.2 :creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection : None
5.2 :of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding, : None
5.2 :and many other evidences proclaim her with all : None
5.2 :certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see : None
5.2 :the meeting of the two kings? : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN
5.2 :No. : None
THIRD GENTLEMAN
5.2 :Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen, : None
5.2 :cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one : None
5.2 :joy crown another, so and in such manner that it : None
5.2 :seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their : None
5.2 :joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, : None
5.2 :holding up of hands, with countenances of such : None
5.2 :distraction that they were to be known by garment, : None
5.2 :not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of : None
5.2 :himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that : None
5.2 :joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother, : None
5.2 :thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then : None
5.2 :embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his : None
5.2 :daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old : None
5.2 :shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten : None
5.2 :conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such : None
5.2 :another encounter, which lames report to follow it : None
5.2 :and undoes description to do it. : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN
5.2 :What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried : None
5.2 :hence the child? : None
THIRD GENTLEMAN
5.2 :Like an old tale still, which will have matter to : None
5.2 :rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear : None
5.2 :open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this : None
5.2 :avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his : None
5.2 :innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a : None
5.2 :handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows. : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
5.2 :What became of his bark and his followers? : None
THIRD GENTLEMAN
5.2 :Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and : None
5.2 :in the view of the shepherd: so that all the : None
5.2 :instruments which aided to expose the child were : None
5.2 :even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble : None
5.2 :combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in : None
5.2 :Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of : None
5.2 :her husband, another elevated that the oracle was : None
5.2 :fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth, : None
5.2 :and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin : None
5.2 :her to her heart that she might no more be in danger : None
5.2 :of losing. : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
5.2 :The dignity of this act was worth the audience of : None
5.2 :kings and princes; for by such was it acted. : None
THIRD GENTLEMAN
5.2 :One of the prettiest touches of all and that which : None
5.2 :angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not : None
5.2 :the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's : None
5.2 :death, with the manner how she came to't bravely : None
5.2 :confessed and lamented by the king, how : None
5.2 :attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one : None
5.2 :sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,' : None
5.2 :I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my : None
5.2 :heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed : None
5.2 :colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world : None
5.2 :could have seen 't, the woe had been universal. : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
5.2 :Are they returned to the court? : None
THIRD GENTLEMAN
5.2 :No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue, : None
5.2 :which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many : None
5.2 :years in doing and now newly performed by that rare : None
5.2 :Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself : None
5.2 :eternity and could put breath into his work, would : None
5.2 :beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her : None
5.2 :ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that : None
5.2 :they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of : None
5.2 :answer: thither with all greediness of affection : None
5.2 :are they gone, and there they intend to sup. : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN
5.2 :I thought she had some great matter there in hand; : None
5.2 :for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever : None
5.2 :since the death of Hermione, visited that removed : None
5.2 :house. Shall we thither and with our company piece : None
5.2 :the rejoicing? : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
5.2 :Who would be thence that has the benefit of access? : None
5.2 :every wink of an eye some new grace will be born: : None
5.2 :our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge. : None
5.2 :Let's along. : None
Exeunt Gentlemen : ['Exeunt - []'] : FIRST GENTLEMAN
AUTOLYCUS
5.2 :Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, : None
5.2 :would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old : None
5.2 :man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard : None
5.2 :them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he : None
5.2 :at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter, : None
5.2 :so he then took her to be, who began to be much : None
5.2 :sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of : None
5.2 :weather continuing, this mystery remained : None
5.2 :undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I : None
5.2 :been the finder out of this secret, it would not : None
5.2 :have relished among my other discredits. : None
Enter Shepherd and Clown : ["Enter - ['SHEPHERD', 'CLOWN']"] : AUTOLYCUS
5.2 :Here come those I have done good to against my will, : None
5.2 :and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune. : None
SHEPHERD
5.2 :Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and : None
5.2 :daughters will be all gentlemen born. : None
CLOWN
5.2 :You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me : None
5.2 :this other day, because I was no gentleman born. : None
5.2 :See you these clothes? say you see them not and : None
5.2 :think me still no gentleman born: you were best say : None
5.2 :these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the : None
5.2 :lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born. : None
AUTOLYCUS
5.2 :I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born. : None
CLOWN
5.2 :Ay, and have been so any time these four hours. : None
SHEPHERD
5.2 :And so have I, boy. : None

LEONTES
5.3 :O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort : None
5.3 :That I have had of thee! : None
PAULINA
5.3 :What, sovereign sir, : None
5.3 :I did not well I meant well. All my services : None
5.3 :You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed, : None
5.3 :With your crown'd brother and these your contracted : None
5.3 :Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit, : None
5.3 :It is a surplus of your grace, which never : None
5.3 :My life may last to answer. : None
LEONTES
5.3 :O Paulina, : None
5.3 :We honour you with trouble: but we came : None
5.3 :To see the statue of our queen: your gallery : None
5.3 :Have we pass'd through, not without much content : None
5.3 :In many singularities; but we saw not : None
5.3 :That which my daughter came to look upon, : None
5.3 :The statue of her mother. : None
PAULINA
5.3 :As she lived peerless, : None
5.3 :So her dead likeness, I do well believe, : None
5.3 :Excels whatever yet you look'd upon : None
5.3 :Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it : None
5.3 :Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare : None
5.3 :To see the life as lively mock'd as ever : None
5.3 :Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well. : None
PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue : ["None - ['PAULINA', 'HERMIONE']"] : PAULINA
5.3 :I like your silence, it the more shows off : None
5.3 :Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege, : None
5.3 :Comes it not something near? : None
LEONTES
5.3 :Her natural posture! : None
5.3 :Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed : None
5.3 :Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she : None
5.3 :In thy not chiding, for she was as tender : None
5.3 :As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina, : None
5.3 :Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing : None
5.3 :So aged as this seems. : None
POLIXENES
5.3 :O, not by much. : None
PAULINA
5.3 :So much the more our carver's excellence; : None

LEONTES
5.3 :                  As now she might have done, : None
5.3 :So much to my good comfort, as it is : None
5.3 :Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood, : None
5.3 :Even with such life of majesty, warm life, : None
5.3 :As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her! : None
5.3 :I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me : None
5.3 :For being more stone than it? O royal piece, : None
5.3 :There's magic in thy majesty, which has : None
5.3 :My evils conjured to remembrance and : None
5.3 :From thy admiring daughter took the spirits, : None
5.3 :Standing like stone with thee. : None
PERDITA
5.3 :And give me leave, : None
5.3 :And do not say 'tis superstition, that : None

5.3 :Dear queen, that ended when I but began, : None
5.3 :Give me that hand of yours to kiss. : None
PAULINA
5.3 :O, patience! : None
5.3 :The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry. : None
CAMILLO
5.3 :My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on, : None
5.3 :Which sixteen winters cannot blow away, : None
5.3 :So many summers dry; scarce any joy : None
5.3 :Did ever so long live; no sorrow : None
5.3 :But kill'd itself much sooner. : None
POLIXENES
5.3 :Dear my brother, : None
5.3 :Let him that was the cause of this have power : None
5.3 :To take off so much grief from you as he : None
5.3 :Will piece up in himself. : None
PAULINA
5.3 :Indeed, my lord, : None
5.3 :If I had thought the sight of my poor image : None

5.3 :Let be, let be. : None
5.3 :Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already-- : None

POLIXENES
5.3 :Masterly done: : None
5.3 :The very life seems warm upon her lip. : None
LEONTES
5.3 :The fixture of her eye has motion in't, : None

PAULINA
5.3 :I'll draw the curtain: : None
5.3 :My lord's almost so far transported that : None

LEONTES
5.3 :O sweet Paulina, : None
5.3 :Make me to think so twenty years together! : None
5.3 :No settled senses of the world can match : None
5.3 :The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone. : None
PAULINA
5.3 :I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but : None
5.3 :I could afflict you farther. : None
LEONTES
5.3 :Do, Paulina; : None
5.3 :For this affliction has a taste as sweet : None
5.3 :As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks, : None
5.3 :There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel : None
5.3 :Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me, : None
5.3 :For I will kiss her. : None
PAULINA
5.3 :Good my lord, forbear: : None
5.3 :The ruddiness upon her lip is wet; : None
5.3 :You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own : None
5.3 :With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain? : None
LEONTES
5.3 :No, not these twenty years. : None
PERDITA
5.3 :So long could I : None
5.3 :Stand by, a looker on. : None
PAULINA
5.3 :Either forbear, : None
5.3 :Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you : None
5.3 :For more amazement. If you can behold it, : None
5.3 :I'll make the statue move indeed, descend : None
5.3 :And take you by the hand; but then you'll think-- : None
5.3 :Which I protest against--I am assisted : None
5.3 :By wicked powers. : None
LEONTES
5.3 :                  What you can make her do, : None

5.3 :To make her speak as move. : None
PAULINA

5.3 :Were it but told you, should be hooted at : None
5.3 :Like an old tale: but it appears she lives, : None
5.3 :Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while. : None

PAULINA
5.3 :There's time enough for that; : None
5.3 :Lest they desire upon this push to trouble : None
5.3 :Your joys with like relation. Go together, : None
5.3 :You precious winners all; your exultation : None

5.3 :Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there : None
5.3 :My mate, that's never to be found again, : None
5.3 :Lament till I am lost. : None

5.3 :O, peace, Paulina! : None
5.3 :Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent, : None
5.3 :As I by thine a wife: this is a match, : None

5.3 :But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her, : None
5.3 :As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many : None
5.3 :A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far-- : None
5.3 :For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee : None
