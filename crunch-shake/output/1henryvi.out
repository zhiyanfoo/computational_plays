KING HENRY VI
5.5 :Your wondrous rare description, noble earl, : None
5.5 :Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me: : None
5.5 :Her virtues graced with external gifts : None
5.5 :Do breed love's settled passions in my heart: : None
5.5 :And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts : None
5.5 :Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide, : None
5.5 :So am I driven by breath of her renown : None
5.5 :Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive : None
5.5 :Where I may have fruition of her love. : None
SUFFOLK
5.5 :Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale : None
5.5 :Is but a preface of her worthy praise; : None
5.5 :The chief perfections of that lovely dame : None
5.5 :Had I sufficient skill to utter them, : None
5.5 :Would make a volume of enticing lines, : None
5.5 :Able to ravish any dull conceit: : None
5.5 :And, which is more, she is not so divine, : None
5.5 :So full-replete with choice of all delights, : None
5.5 :But with as humble lowliness of mind : None
5.5 :She is content to be at your command; : None
5.5 :Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents, : None
5.5 :To love and honour Henry as her lord. : None
KING HENRY VI
5.5 :And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume. : None
5.5 :Therefore, my lord protector, give consent : None
5.5 :That Margaret may be England's royal queen. : None
GLOUCESTER
5.5 :So should I give consent to flatter sin. : None
5.5 :You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd : None
5.5 :Unto another lady of esteem: : None
5.5 :How shall we then dispense with that contract, : None
5.5 :And not deface your honour with reproach? : None
SUFFOLK
5.5 :As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths; : None
5.5 :Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd : None
5.5 :To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists : None
5.5 :By reason of his adversary's odds: : None
5.5 :A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds, : None
5.5 :And therefore may be broke without offence. : None
GLOUCESTER
5.5 :Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that? : None
5.5 :Her father is no better than an earl, : None
5.5 :Although in glorious titles he excel. : None
SUFFOLK
5.5 :Yes, lord, her father is a king, : None

5.5 :And of such great authority in France : None
5.5 :As his alliance will confirm our peace : None
5.5 :And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance. : None
GLOUCESTER
5.5 :And so the Earl of Armagnac may do, : None
5.5 :Because he is near kinsman unto Charles. : None
EXETER

5.5 :Where Reignier sooner will receive than give. : None
SUFFOLK
5.5 :A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king, : None
5.5 :That he should be so abject, base and poor, : None
5.5 :To choose for wealth and not for perfect love. : None
5.5 :Henry is able to enrich his queen : None

5.5 :So worthless peasants bargain for their wives, : None
5.5 :As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse. : None
5.5 :Marriage is a matter of more worth : None
5.5 :Than to be dealt in by attorneyship; : None
5.5 :Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects, : None

5.5 :And therefore, lords, since he affects her most, : None
5.5 :It most of all these reasons bindeth us, : None
5.5 :In our opinions she should be preferr'd. : None
5.5 :For what is wedlock forced but a hell, : None
5.5 :An age of discord and continual strife? : None
5.5 :Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss, : None
5.5 :And is a pattern of celestial peace. : None
5.5 :Whom should we match with Henry, being a king, : None
5.5 :But Margaret, that is daughter to a king? : None
5.5 :Her peerless feature, joined with her birth, : None
5.5 :Approves her fit for none but for a king: : None
5.5 :Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit, : None
5.5 :More than in women commonly is seen, : None
5.5 :Will answer our hope in issue of a king; : None

5.5 :Is likely to beget more conquerors, : None
5.5 :If with a lady of so high resolve : None
5.5 :As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love. : None

5.5 :With any passion of inflaming love, : None
5.5 :I cannot tell; but this I am assured, : None
5.5 :I feel such sharp dissension in my breast, : None
5.5 :Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear, : None
5.5 :As I am sick with working of my thoughts. : None

5.5 :Agree to any covenants, and procure : None
5.5 :That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come : None

5.5 :And you, good uncle, banish all offence: : None
5.5 :If you do censure me by what you were, : None
5.5 :Not what you are, I know it will excuse : None
