Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a Messenger : ["Enter - ['LEONATO', 'HERO', 'BEATRICE', 'MESSENGER']"] : None
LEONATO
1.1 :I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon : None
1.1 :comes this night to Messina. : None
MESSENGER
1.1 :He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off : None
1.1 :when I left him. : None
LEONATO
1.1 :How many gentlemen have you lost in this action? : None
MESSENGER
1.1 :But few of any sort, and none of name. : None
LEONATO
1.1 :A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings : None
1.1 :home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath : None
1.1 :bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio. : None
MESSENGER
1.1 :Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by : None
1.1 :Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the : None
1.1 :promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb, : None
1.1 :the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better : None
1.1 :bettered expectation than you must expect of me to : None
1.1 :tell you how. : None
LEONATO
1.1 :He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much : None
1.1 :glad of it. : None
MESSENGER
1.1 :I have already delivered him letters, and there : None
1.1 :appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could : None
1.1 :not show itself modest enough without a badge of : None
1.1 :bitterness. : None
LEONATO
1.1 :Did he break out into tears? : None
MESSENGER
1.1 :In great measure. : None
LEONATO
1.1 :A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces : None
1.1 :truer than those that are so washed. How much : None
1.1 :better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping! : None
BEATRICE
1.1 :I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the : None
1.1 :wars or no? : None
MESSENGER
1.1 :I know none of that name, lady: there was none such : None
1.1 :in the army of any sort. : None
LEONATO
1.1 :What is he that you ask for, niece? : None
HERO
1.1 :My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua. : None
MESSENGER
1.1 :O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was. : None
BEATRICE
1.1 :He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged : None
1.1 :Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading : None
1.1 :the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged : None
1.1 :him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he : None
1.1 :killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath : None
1.1 :he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing. : None
LEONATO
1.1 :Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much; : None
1.1 :but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not. : None
MESSENGER
1.1 :He hath done good service, lady, in these wars. : None
BEATRICE
1.1 :You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it: : None
1.1 :he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an : None
1.1 :excellent stomach. : None
MESSENGER
1.1 :And a good soldier too, lady. : None
BEATRICE
1.1 :And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord? : None
MESSENGER
1.1 :A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all : None
1.1 :honourable virtues. : None
BEATRICE
1.1 :It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man: : None
1.1 :but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal. : None
LEONATO
1.1 :You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a : None
1.1 :kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her: : None
1.1 :they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit : None
1.1 :between them. : None
BEATRICE
1.1 :Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last : None
1.1 :conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and : None
1.1 :now is the whole man governed with one: so that if : None
1.1 :he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him : None
1.1 :bear it for a difference between himself and his : None
1.1 :horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left, : None
1.1 :to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his : None
1.1 :companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother. : None
MESSENGER
1.1 :Is't possible? : None
BEATRICE
1.1 :Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as : None
1.1 :the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the : None
1.1 :next block. : None
MESSENGER
1.1 :I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books. : None
BEATRICE
1.1 :No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray : None
1.1 :you, who is his companion? Is there no young : None
1.1 :squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil? : None
MESSENGER
1.1 :He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio. : None
BEATRICE
1.1 :O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he : None
1.1 :is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker : None
1.1 :runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if : None
1.1 :he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a : None
1.1 :thousand pound ere a' be cured. : None
MESSENGER
1.1 :I will hold friends with you, lady. : None
BEATRICE
1.1 :Do, good friend. : None
LEONATO
1.1 :You will never run mad, niece. : None
BEATRICE
1.1 :No, not till a hot January. : None
MESSENGER
1.1 :Don Pedro is approached. : None
Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASAR : ["Enter - ['DON PEDRO', 'DON JOHN', 'CLAUDIO', 'BENEDICK', 'BALTHASAR']"] : MESSENGER
DON PEDRO
1.1 :Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your : None
1.1 :trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid : None
1.1 :cost, and you encounter it. : None
LEONATO
1.1 :Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of : None
1.1 :your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should : None
1.1 :remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides : None
1.1 :and happiness takes his leave. : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this : None
1.1 :is your daughter. : None
LEONATO
1.1 :Her mother hath many times told me so. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her? : None
LEONATO
1.1 :Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child. : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this : None
1.1 :what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers : None
1.1 :herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an : None
1.1 :honourable father. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not : None
1.1 :have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as : None
1.1 :like him as she is. : None
BEATRICE
1.1 :I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior : None
1.1 :Benedick: nobody marks you. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living? : None
BEATRICE
1.1 :Is it possible disdain should die while she hath : None
1.1 :such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick? : None
1.1 :Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come : None
1.1 :in her presence. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I : None
1.1 :am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I : None
1.1 :would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard : None
1.1 :heart; for, truly, I love none. : None
BEATRICE
1.1 :A dear happiness to women: they would else have : None
1.1 :been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God : None
1.1 :and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I : None
1.1 :had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man : None
1.1 :swear he loves me. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some : None
1.1 :gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate : None
1.1 :scratched face. : None
BEATRICE
1.1 :Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such : None
1.1 :a face as yours were. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher. : None
BEATRICE
1.1 :A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and : None
1.1 :so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's : None
1.1 :name; I have done. : None
BEATRICE
1.1 :You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old. : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio : None
1.1 :and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath : None
1.1 :invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at : None
1.1 :the least a month; and he heartily prays some : None
1.1 :occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no : None
1.1 :hypocrite, but prays from his heart. : None
LEONATO
1.1 :If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn. : None
To DON JOHN : ["To - ['DON JOHN']"] : LEONATO
1.1 :Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to : None
1.1 :the prince your brother, I owe you all duty. : None
DON JOHN
1.1 :I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank : None
1.1 :you. : None
LEONATO
1.1 :Please it your grace lead on? : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :Your hand, Leonato; we will go together. : None
Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO : ["Exeunt - ['BENEDICK', 'CLAUDIO']"] : DON PEDRO
CLAUDIO
1.1 :Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato? : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :I noted her not; but I looked on her. : None
CLAUDIO
1.1 :Is she not a modest young lady? : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for : None
1.1 :my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak : None
1.1 :after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex? : None
CLAUDIO
1.1 :No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high : None
1.1 :praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little : None
1.1 :for a great praise: only this commendation I can : None
1.1 :afford her, that were she other than she is, she : None
1.1 :were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I : None
1.1 :do not like her. : None
CLAUDIO
1.1 :Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me : None
1.1 :truly how thou likest her. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :Would you buy her, that you inquire after her? : None
CLAUDIO
1.1 :Can the world buy such a jewel? : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this : None
1.1 :with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack, : None
1.1 :to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a : None
1.1 :rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take : None
1.1 :you, to go in the song? : None
CLAUDIO
1.1 :In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I : None
1.1 :looked on. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such : None
1.1 :matter: there's her cousin, an she were not : None
1.1 :possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty : None
1.1 :as the first of May doth the last of December. But I : None
1.1 :hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you? : None
CLAUDIO
1.1 :I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the : None
1.1 :contrary, if Hero would be my wife. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world : None
1.1 :one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion? : None
1.1 :Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again? : None
1.1 :Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck : None
1.1 :into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away : None
1.1 :Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you. : None
Re-enter DON PEDRO : ["Re-enter - ['DON PEDRO']"] : BENEDICK
DON PEDRO
1.1 :What secret hath held you here, that you followed : None
1.1 :not to Leonato's? : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :I would your grace would constrain me to tell. : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :I charge thee on thy allegiance. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb : None
1.1 :man; I would have you think so; but, on my : None
1.1 :allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is : None
1.1 :in love. With who? now that is your grace's part. : None
1.1 :Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato's : None
1.1 :short daughter. : None
CLAUDIO
1.1 :If this were so, so were it uttered. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor : None
1.1 :'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be : None
1.1 :so.' : None
CLAUDIO
1.1 :If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it : None
1.1 :should be otherwise. : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy. : None
CLAUDIO
1.1 :You speak this to fetch me in, my lord. : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :By my troth, I speak my thought. : None
CLAUDIO
1.1 :And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine. : None
CLAUDIO
1.1 :That I love her, I feel. : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :That she is worthy, I know. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :That I neither feel how she should be loved nor : None
1.1 :know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that : None
1.1 :fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake. : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite : None
1.1 :of beauty. : None
CLAUDIO
1.1 :And never could maintain his part but in the force : None
1.1 :of his will. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she : None
1.1 :brought me up, I likewise give her most humble : None
1.1 :thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my : None
1.1 :forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick, : None
1.1 :all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do : None
1.1 :them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the : None
1.1 :right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which : None
1.1 :I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor. : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord, : None
1.1 :not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood : None
1.1 :with love than I will get again with drinking, pick : None
1.1 :out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me : None
1.1 :up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of : None
1.1 :blind Cupid. : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou : None
1.1 :wilt prove a notable argument. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot : None
1.1 :at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on : None
1.1 :the shoulder, and called Adam. : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull : None
1.1 :doth bear the yoke.' : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible : None
1.1 :Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set : None
1.1 :them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted, : None
1.1 :and in such great letters as they write 'Here is : None
1.1 :good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign : None
1.1 :'Here you may see Benedick the married man.' : None
CLAUDIO
1.1 :If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad. : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in : None
1.1 :Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :I look for an earthquake too, then. : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :Well, you temporize with the hours. In the : None
1.1 :meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to : None
1.1 :Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will : None
1.1 :not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made : None
1.1 :great preparation. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :I have almost matter enough in me for such an : None
1.1 :embassage; and so I commit you-- : None
CLAUDIO
1.1 :To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,-- : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick. : None
BENEDICK
1.1 :Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your : None
1.1 :discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and : None
1.1 :the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere : None
1.1 :you flout old ends any further, examine your : None
1.1 :conscience: and so I leave you. : None
Exit : ['Exit - []'] : BENEDICK
CLAUDIO
1.1 :My liege, your highness now may do me good. : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :My love is thine to teach: teach it but how, : None
1.1 :And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn : None
1.1 :Any hard lesson that may do thee good. : None
CLAUDIO
1.1 :Hath Leonato any son, my lord? : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :No child but Hero; she's his only heir. : None
1.1 :Dost thou affect her, Claudio? : None
CLAUDIO
1.1 :O, my lord, : None
1.1 :When you went onward on this ended action, : None
1.1 :I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye, : None
1.1 :That liked, but had a rougher task in hand : None
1.1 :Than to drive liking to the name of love: : None
1.1 :But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts : None
1.1 :Have left their places vacant, in their rooms : None
1.1 :Come thronging soft and delicate desires, : None
1.1 :All prompting me how fair young Hero is, : None
1.1 :Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars. : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :Thou wilt be like a lover presently : None
1.1 :And tire the hearer with a book of words. : None
1.1 :If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it, : None
1.1 :And I will break with her and with her father, : None
1.1 :And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end : None
1.1 :That thou began'st to twist so fine a story? : None
CLAUDIO
1.1 :How sweetly you do minister to love, : None
1.1 :That know love's grief by his complexion! : None
1.1 :But lest my liking might too sudden seem, : None
1.1 :I would have salved it with a longer treatise. : None
DON PEDRO
1.1 :What need the bridge much broader than the flood? : None
1.1 :The fairest grant is the necessity. : None
1.1 :Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest, : None
1.1 :And I will fit thee with the remedy. : None
1.1 :I know we shall have revelling to-night: : None
1.1 :I will assume thy part in some disguise : None
1.1 :And tell fair Hero I am Claudio, : None
1.1 :And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart : None
1.1 :And take her hearing prisoner with the force : None
1.1 :And strong encounter of my amorous tale: : None
1.1 :Then after to her father will I break; : None
1.1 :And the conclusion is, she shall be thine. : None
1.1 :In practise let us put it presently. : None
Exeunt : ['Exeunt - []'] : DON PEDRO

Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meeting : ["Enter - ['LEONATO', 'ANTONIO']"] : DON PEDRO
LEONATO
1.2 :How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son? : None
1.2 :hath he provided this music? : None
ANTONIO
1.2 :He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell : None
1.2 :you strange news that you yet dreamt not of. : None
LEONATO
1.2 :Are they good? : None
ANTONIO
1.2 :As the event stamps them: but they have a good : None
1.2 :cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count : None
1.2 :Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine : None
1.2 :orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine: : None
1.2 :the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my : None
1.2 :niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it : None
1.2 :this night in a dance: and if he found her : None
1.2 :accordant, he meant to take the present time by the : None
1.2 :top and instantly break with you of it. : None
LEONATO
1.2 :Hath the fellow any wit that told you this? : None
ANTONIO
1.2 :A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and : None
1.2 :question him yourself. : None
LEONATO
1.2 :No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear : None
1.2 :itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal, : None
1.2 :that she may be the better prepared for an answer, : None
1.2 :if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it. : None
Enter Attendants : ['Enter - []'] : LEONATO
1.2 :Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you : None
1.2 :mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your : None
1.2 :skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time. : None
Exeunt : ['Exeunt - []'] : LEONATO
Scene(scene=3)
Enter DON JOHN and CONRADE : ["Enter - ['DON JOHN', 'CONRADE']"] : LEONATO
CONRADE
1.3 :What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out : None
1.3 :of measure sad? : None
DON JOHN
1.3 :There is no measure in the occasion that breeds; : None
1.3 :therefore the sadness is without limit. : None
CONRADE
1.3 :You should hear reason. : None
DON JOHN
1.3 :And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it? : None
CONRADE
1.3 :If not a present remedy, at least a patient : None
1.3 :sufferance. : None
DON JOHN
1.3 :I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art, : None
1.3 :born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral : None
1.3 :medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide : None
1.3 :what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile : None
1.3 :at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait : None
1.3 :for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and : None
1.3 :tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and : None
1.3 :claw no man in his humour. : None
CONRADE
1.3 :Yea, but you must not make the full show of this : None
1.3 :till you may do it without controlment. You have of : None
1.3 :late stood out against your brother, and he hath : None
1.3 :ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is : None
1.3 :impossible you should take true root but by the : None
1.3 :fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful : None
1.3 :that you frame the season for your own harvest. : None
DON JOHN
1.3 :I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in : None
1.3 :his grace, and it better fits my blood to be : None
1.3 :disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob : None
1.3 :love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to : None
1.3 :be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied : None
1.3 :but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with : None
1.3 :a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I : None
1.3 :have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my : None
1.3 :mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do : None
1.3 :my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and : None
1.3 :seek not to alter me. : None
CONRADE
1.3 :Can you make no use of your discontent? : None
DON JOHN
1.3 :I make all use of it, for I use it only. : None
1.3 :Who comes here? : None
Enter BORACHIO : ["Enter - ['BORACHIO']"] : DON JOHN
1.3 :What news, Borachio? : None
BORACHIO
1.3 :I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your : None
1.3 :brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I : None
1.3 :can give you intelligence of an intended marriage. : None
DON JOHN
1.3 :Will it serve for any model to build mischief on? : None
1.3 :What is he for a fool that betroths himself to : None
1.3 :unquietness? : None
BORACHIO
1.3 :Marry, it is your brother's right hand. : None
DON JOHN
1.3 :Who? the most exquisite Claudio? : None
BORACHIO
1.3 :Even he. : None
DON JOHN
1.3 :A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks : None
1.3 :he? : None
BORACHIO
1.3 :Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato. : None
DON JOHN
1.3 :A very forward March-chick! How came you to this? : None
BORACHIO
1.3 :Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a : None
1.3 :musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand : None
1.3 :in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the : None
1.3 :arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the : None
1.3 :prince should woo Hero for himself, and having : None
1.3 :obtained her, give her to Count Claudio. : None
DON JOHN
1.3 :Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to : None
1.3 :my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the : None
1.3 :glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I : None
1.3 :bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me? : None
CONRADE
1.3 :To the death, my lord. : None
DON JOHN
1.3 :Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the : None
1.3 :greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of : None
1.3 :my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done? : None
BORACHIO
1.3 :We'll wait upon your lordship. : None

Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others : ["Enter - ['LEONATO', 'ANTONIO', 'HERO', 'BEATRICE']"] : BORACHIO
LEONATO
2.1 :Was not Count John here at supper? : None
ANTONIO
2.1 :I saw him not. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see : None
2.1 :him but I am heart-burned an hour after. : None
HERO
2.1 :He is of a very melancholy disposition. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :He were an excellent man that were made just in the : None
2.1 :midway between him and Benedick: the one is too : None
2.1 :like an image and says nothing, and the other too : None
2.1 :like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling. : None
LEONATO
2.1 :Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's : None
2.1 :mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior : None
2.1 :Benedick's face,-- : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money : None
2.1 :enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman : None
2.1 :in the world, if a' could get her good-will. : None
LEONATO
2.1 :By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a : None
2.1 :husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue. : None
ANTONIO
2.1 :In faith, she's too curst. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's : None
2.1 :sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst : None
2.1 :cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none. : None
LEONATO
2.1 :So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :Just, if he send me no husband; for the which : None
2.1 :blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and : None
2.1 :evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a : None
2.1 :beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen. : None
LEONATO
2.1 :You may light on a husband that hath no beard. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel : None
2.1 :and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a : None
2.1 :beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no : None
2.1 :beard is less than a man: and he that is more than : None
2.1 :a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a : None
2.1 :man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take : None
2.1 :sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his : None
2.1 :apes into hell. : None
LEONATO
2.1 :Well, then, go you into hell? : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet : None
2.1 :me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and : None
2.1 :say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to : None
2.1 :heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver : None
2.1 :I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the : None
2.1 :heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and : None
2.1 :there live we as merry as the day is long. : None
ANTONIO
2.1 :  Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled : To HERO : ["To - ['HERO']"] : ANTONIO
2.1 :by your father. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy : None
2.1 :and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all : None
2.1 :that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else : None
2.1 :make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please : None
2.1 :me.' : None
LEONATO
2.1 :Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :Not till God make men of some other metal than : None
2.1 :earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be : None
2.1 :overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make : None
2.1 :an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl? : None
2.1 :No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren; : None
2.1 :and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred. : None
LEONATO
2.1 :Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince : None
2.1 :do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be : None
2.1 :not wooed in good time: if the prince be too : None
2.1 :important, tell him there is measure in every thing : None
2.1 :and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero: : None
2.1 :wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig, : None
2.1 :a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot : None
2.1 :and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as : None
2.1 :fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a : None
2.1 :measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes : None
2.1 :repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the : None
2.1 :cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave. : None
LEONATO
2.1 :Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight. : None
LEONATO
2.1 :The revellers are entering, brother: make good room. : None
All put on their masks : ['None - []'] : LEONATO
Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR, DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others, masked : ["Enter - ['DON PEDRO', 'CLAUDIO', 'BENEDICK', 'BALTHASAR', 'DON JOHN', 'BORACHIO', 'MARGARET', 'URSULA']"] : LEONATO
DON PEDRO
2.1 :Lady, will you walk about with your friend? : None
HERO
2.1 :So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing, : None
2.1 :I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :With me in your company? : None
HERO
2.1 :I may say so, when I please. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :And when please you to say so? : None
HERO
2.1 :When I like your favour; for God defend the lute : None
2.1 :should be like the case! : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove. : None
HERO
2.1 :Why, then, your visor should be thatched. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :Speak low, if you speak love. : None
Drawing her aside : ['aside - []'] : DON PEDRO
BALTHASAR
2.1 :Well, I would you did like me. : None
MARGARET
2.1 :So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many : None
2.1 :ill-qualities. : None
BALTHASAR
2.1 :Which is one? : None
MARGARET
2.1 :I say my prayers aloud. : None
BALTHASAR
2.1 :I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen. : None
MARGARET
2.1 :God match me with a good dancer! : None
BALTHASAR
2.1 :Amen. : None
MARGARET
2.1 :And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is : None
2.1 :done! Answer, clerk. : None
BALTHASAR
2.1 :No more words: the clerk is answered. : None
URSULA
2.1 :I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio. : None
ANTONIO
2.1 :At a word, I am not. : None
URSULA
2.1 :I know you by the waggling of your head. : None
ANTONIO
2.1 :To tell you true, I counterfeit him. : None
URSULA
2.1 :You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were : None
2.1 :the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you : None
2.1 :are he, you are he. : None
ANTONIO
2.1 :At a word, I am not. : None
URSULA
2.1 :Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your : None
2.1 :excellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to, : None
2.1 :mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's an : None
2.1 :end. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :Will you not tell me who told you so? : None
BENEDICK
2.1 :No, you shall pardon me. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :Nor will you not tell me who you are? : None
BENEDICK
2.1 :Not now. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit : None
2.1 :out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was : None
2.1 :Signior Benedick that said so. : None
BENEDICK
2.1 :What's he? : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :I am sure you know him well enough. : None
BENEDICK
2.1 :Not I, believe me. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :Did he never make you laugh? : None
BENEDICK
2.1 :I pray you, what is he? : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool; : None
2.1 :only his gift is in devising impossible slanders: : None
2.1 :none but libertines delight in him; and the : None
2.1 :commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany; : None
2.1 :for he both pleases men and angers them, and then : None
2.1 :they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in : None
2.1 :the fleet: I would he had boarded me. : None
BENEDICK
2.1 :When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me; : None
2.1 :which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at, : None
2.1 :strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a : None
2.1 :partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no : None
2.1 :supper that night. : None
Music : ['None - []'] : BEATRICE
2.1 :We must follow the leaders. : None
BENEDICK
2.1 :In every good thing. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at : None
2.1 :the next turning. : None
Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO, and CLAUDIO : ['None - []', "exeunt - ['DON JOHN', 'BORACHIO', 'CLAUDIO']"] : BEATRICE
DON JOHN
2.1 :Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath : None
2.1 :withdrawn her father to break with him about it. : None
2.1 :The ladies follow her and but one visor remains. : None
BORACHIO
2.1 :And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing. : None
DON JOHN
2.1 :Are not you Signior Benedick? : None
CLAUDIO
2.1 :You know me well; I am he. : None
DON JOHN
2.1 :Signior, you are very near my brother in his love: : None
2.1 :he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him : None
2.1 :from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may : None
2.1 :do the part of an honest man in it. : None
CLAUDIO
2.1 :How know you he loves her? : None
DON JOHN
2.1 :I heard him swear his affection. : None
BORACHIO
2.1 :So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night. : None
DON JOHN
2.1 :Come, let us to the banquet. : None
Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO : ["Exeunt - ['DON JOHN', 'BORACHIO']"] : DON JOHN
CLAUDIO
2.1 :Thus answer I in the name of Benedick, : None
2.1 :But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio. : None
2.1 :'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself. : None
2.1 :Friendship is constant in all other things : None
2.1 :Save in the office and affairs of love: : None
2.1 :Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues; : None
2.1 :Let every eye negotiate for itself : None
2.1 :And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch : None
2.1 :Against whose charms faith melteth into blood. : None
2.1 :This is an accident of hourly proof, : None
2.1 :Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero! : None
Re-enter BENEDICK : ["Re-enter - ['BENEDICK']"] : CLAUDIO
BENEDICK
2.1 :Count Claudio? : None
CLAUDIO
2.1 :Yea, the same. : None
BENEDICK
2.1 :Come, will you go with me? : None
CLAUDIO
2.1 :Whither? : None
BENEDICK
2.1 :Even to the next willow, about your own business, : None
2.1 :county. What fashion will you wear the garland of? : None
2.1 :about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or under : None
2.1 :your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear : None
2.1 :it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero. : None
CLAUDIO
2.1 :I wish him joy of her. : None
BENEDICK
2.1 :Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they : None
2.1 :sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would : None
2.1 :have served you thus? : None
CLAUDIO
2.1 :I pray you, leave me. : None
BENEDICK
2.1 :Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the : None
2.1 :boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post. : None
CLAUDIO
2.1 :If it will not be, I'll leave you. : None
Exit : ['Exit - []'] : CLAUDIO
BENEDICK
2.1 :Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges. : None
2.1 :But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not : None
2.1 :know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go : None
2.1 :under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I : None
2.1 :am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it : None
2.1 :is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice : None
2.1 :that puts the world into her person and so gives me : None
2.1 :out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may. : None
Re-enter DON PEDRO : ["Re-enter - ['DON PEDRO']"] : BENEDICK
DON PEDRO
2.1 :Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him? : None
BENEDICK
2.1 :Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame. : None
2.1 :I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a : None
2.1 :warren: I told him, and I think I told him true, : None
2.1 :that your grace had got the good will of this young : None
2.1 :lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree, : None
2.1 :either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or : None
2.1 :to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :To be whipped! What's his fault? : None
BENEDICK
2.1 :The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being : None
2.1 :overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his : None
2.1 :companion, and he steals it. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The : None
2.1 :transgression is in the stealer. : None
BENEDICK
2.1 :Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made, : None
2.1 :and the garland too; for the garland he might have : None
2.1 :worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on : None
2.1 :you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to : None
2.1 :the owner. : None
BENEDICK
2.1 :If their singing answer your saying, by my faith, : None
2.1 :you say honestly. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the : None
2.1 :gentleman that danced with her told her she is much : None
2.1 :wronged by you. : None
BENEDICK
2.1 :O, she misused me past the endurance of a block! : None
2.1 :an oak but with one green leaf on it would have : None
2.1 :answered her; my very visor began to assume life and : None
2.1 :scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been : None
2.1 :myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was : None
2.1 :duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest : None
2.1 :with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood : None
2.1 :like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at : None
2.1 :me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs: : None
2.1 :if her breath were as terrible as her terminations, : None
2.1 :there were no living near her; she would infect to : None
2.1 :the north star. I would not marry her, though she : None
2.1 :were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before : None
2.1 :he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have : None
2.1 :turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make : None
2.1 :the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find : None
2.1 :her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God : None
2.1 :some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while : None
2.1 :she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a : None
2.1 :sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they : None
2.1 :would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror : None
2.1 :and perturbation follows her. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :Look, here she comes. : None
Enter CLAUDIO, BEATRICE, HERO, and LEONATO : ["Enter - ['CLAUDIO', 'BEATRICE', 'HERO', 'LEONATO']"] : DON PEDRO
BENEDICK
2.1 :Will your grace command me any service to the : None
2.1 :world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now : None
2.1 :to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on; : None
2.1 :I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the : None
2.1 :furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of : None
2.1 :Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great : None
2.1 :Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies, : None
2.1 :rather than hold three words' conference with this : None
2.1 :harpy. You have no employment for me? : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :None, but to desire your good company. : None
BENEDICK
2.1 :O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot : None
2.1 :endure my Lady Tongue. : None
Exit : ['Exit - []'] : BENEDICK
DON PEDRO
2.1 :Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of : None
2.1 :Signior Benedick. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave : None
2.1 :him use for it, a double heart for his single one: : None
2.1 :marry, once before he won it of me with false dice, : None
2.1 :therefore your grace may well say I have lost it. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :You have put him down, lady, you have put him down. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I : None
2.1 :should prove the mother of fools. I have brought : None
2.1 :Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad? : None
CLAUDIO
2.1 :Not sad, my lord. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :How then? sick? : None
CLAUDIO
2.1 :Neither, my lord. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor : None
2.1 :well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and : None
2.1 :something of that jealous complexion. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true; : None
2.1 :though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is : None
2.1 :false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and : None
2.1 :fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father, : None
2.1 :and his good will obtained: name the day of : None
2.1 :marriage, and God give thee joy! : None
LEONATO
2.1 :Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my : None
2.1 :fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an : None
2.1 :grace say Amen to it. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :Speak, count, 'tis your cue. : None
CLAUDIO
2.1 :Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were : None
2.1 :but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as : None
2.1 :you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for : None
2.1 :you and dote upon the exchange. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth : None
2.1 :with a kiss, and let not him speak neither. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :In faith, lady, you have a merry heart. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on : None
2.1 :the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his : None
2.1 :ear that he is in her heart. : None
CLAUDIO
2.1 :And so she doth, cousin. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the : None
2.1 :world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a : None
2.1 :corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband! : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :Lady Beatrice, I will get you one. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :I would rather have one of your father's getting. : None
2.1 :Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your : None
2.1 :father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :Will you have me, lady? : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :No, my lord, unless I might have another for : None
2.1 :working-days: your grace is too costly to wear : None
2.1 :every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I : None
2.1 :was born to speak all mirth and no matter. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best : None
2.1 :becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in : None
2.1 :a merry hour. : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there : None
2.1 :was a star danced, and under that was I born. : None
2.1 :Cousins, God give you joy! : None
LEONATO
2.1 :Niece, will you look to those things I told you of? : None
BEATRICE
2.1 :I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon. : None
Exit : ['Exit - []'] : BEATRICE
DON PEDRO
2.1 :By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady. : None
LEONATO
2.1 :There's little of the melancholy element in her, my : None
2.1 :lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and : None
2.1 :not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say, : None
2.1 :she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked : None
2.1 :herself with laughing. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband. : None
LEONATO
2.1 :O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :She were an excellent wife for Benedict. : None
LEONATO
2.1 :O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married, : None
2.1 :they would talk themselves mad. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :County Claudio, when mean you to go to church? : None
CLAUDIO
2.1 :To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till love : None
2.1 :have all his rites. : None
LEONATO
2.1 :Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just : None
2.1 :seven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have all : None
2.1 :things answer my mind. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing: : None
2.1 :but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go : None
2.1 :dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of : None
2.1 :Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior : None
2.1 :Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of : None
2.1 :affection the one with the other. I would fain have : None
2.1 :it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if : None
2.1 :you three will but minister such assistance as I : None
2.1 :shall give you direction. : None
LEONATO
2.1 :My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten : None
2.1 :nights' watchings. : None
CLAUDIO
2.1 :And I, my lord. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :And you too, gentle Hero? : None
HERO
2.1 :I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my : None
2.1 :cousin to a good husband. : None
DON PEDRO
2.1 :And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that : None
2.1 :I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble : None
2.1 :strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I : None
2.1 :will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she : None
2.1 :shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your : None
2.1 :two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in : None
2.1 :despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he : None
2.1 :shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this, : None

Enter DON JOHN and BORACHIO : ["Enter - ['DON JOHN', 'BORACHIO']"] : DON PEDRO
DON JOHN
2.2 :It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the : None
2.2 :daughter of Leonato. : None
BORACHIO
2.2 :Yea, my lord; but I can cross it. : None
DON JOHN
2.2 :Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be : None
2.2 :medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him, : None
2.2 :and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges : None
2.2 :evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage? : None
BORACHIO
2.2 :Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no : None
2.2 :dishonesty shall appear in me. : None
DON JOHN
2.2 :Show me briefly how. : None
BORACHIO
2.2 :I think I told your lordship a year since, how much : None
2.2 :I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting : None
2.2 :gentlewoman to Hero. : None
DON JOHN
2.2 :I remember. : None
BORACHIO
2.2 :I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night, : None
2.2 :appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window. : None
DON JOHN
2.2 :What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage? : None
BORACHIO
2.2 :The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to : None
2.2 :the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that : None
2.2 :he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned : None
2.2 :Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold : None
2.2 :up--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero. : None
DON JOHN
2.2 :What proof shall I make of that? : None
BORACHIO
2.2 :Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio, : None
2.2 :to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any : None
2.2 :other issue? : None
DON JOHN
2.2 :Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing. : None
BORACHIO
2.2 :Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and : None
2.2 :the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know : None
2.2 :that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the : None
2.2 :prince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother's : None
2.2 :honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's : None
2.2 :reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the : None
2.2 :semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered : None
2.2 :thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial: : None
2.2 :offer them instances; which shall bear no less : None
2.2 :likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window, : None
2.2 :hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me : None
2.2 :Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night : None
2.2 :before the intended wedding,--for in the meantime I : None
2.2 :will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be : None
2.2 :absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth : None
2.2 :of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called : None
2.2 :assurance and all the preparation overthrown. : None
DON JOHN
2.2 :Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put : None
2.2 :it in practise. Be cunning in the working this, and : None
2.2 :thy fee is a thousand ducats. : None
BORACHIO
2.2 :Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning : None
2.2 :shall not shame me. : None
DON JOHN
2.2 :I will presently go learn their day of marriage. : None

BENEDICK

Exit Boy : ["Exit - ['BOY']"] : BENEDICK
2.3 :I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much : None
2.3 :another man is a fool when he dedicates his : None
2.3 :behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at : None
2.3 :such shallow follies in others, become the argument : None
2.3 :of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man : None
2.3 :is Claudio. I have known when there was no music : None
2.3 :with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he : None
2.3 :rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known : None
2.3 :when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a : None
2.3 :good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake, : None
2.3 :carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to : None
2.3 :speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man : None
2.3 :and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his : None
2.3 :words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many : None
2.3 :strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with : None
2.3 :these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not : None
2.3 :be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but : None
2.3 :I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster : None
2.3 :of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman : None
2.3 :is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am : None
2.3 :well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all : None
2.3 :graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in : None
2.3 :my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise, : None
2.3 :or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her; : None
2.3 :fair, or I'll   never look on her; mild, or come not : None
2.3 :near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good : None
2.3 :discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall : None

BALTHASAR
2.3 :O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice : None
2.3 :To slander music any more than once. : None
DON PEDRO
2.3 :It is the witness still of excellency : None
2.3 :To put a strange face on his own perfection. : None
2.3 :I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more. : None
BALTHASAR
2.3 :Because you talk of wooing, I will sing; : None
2.3 :Since many a wooer doth commence his suit : None
2.3 :To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes, : None
2.3 :Yet will he swear he loves. : None
DON PEDRO
2.3 :Now, pray thee, come; : None
2.3 :Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument, : None
2.3 :Do it in notes. : None
BALTHASAR
2.3 :                  Note this before my notes; : None
2.3 :There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting. : None

DON PEDRO
2.3 :Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift. : None
BENEDICK
2.3 :An he had been a dog that should have howled thus, : None

DON PEDRO
2.3 :Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee, : None

Exit BALTHASAR : ["Exit - ['BALTHASAR']"] : DON PEDRO
2.3 :Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of : None
2.3 :to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with : None
2.3 :Signior Benedick? : None
CLAUDIO
2.3 :O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did : None
2.3 :never think that lady would have loved any man. : None
LEONATO
2.3 :No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she : None
2.3 :should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in : None
2.3 :all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor. : None
BENEDICK
2.3 :Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner? : None
LEONATO
2.3 :By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think : None
2.3 :of it but that she loves him with an enraged : None
2.3 :affection: it is past the infinite of thought. : None
DON PEDRO
2.3 :May be she doth but counterfeit. : None
CLAUDIO
2.3 :Faith, like enough. : None
LEONATO
2.3 :O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of : None
2.3 :passion came so near the life of passion as she : None
2.3 :discovers it. : None
DON PEDRO
2.3 :Why, what effects of passion shows she? : None
CLAUDIO
2.3 :Bait the hook well; this fish will bite. : None
LEONATO
2.3 :What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard : None
2.3 :my daughter tell you how. : None
CLAUDIO
2.3 :She did, indeed. : None
DON PEDRO
2.3 :How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I : None
2.3 :thought her spirit had been invincible against all : None
2.3 :assaults of affection. : None
LEONATO
2.3 :I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially : None
2.3 :against Benedick. : None
BENEDICK
2.3 :I should think this a gull, but that the : None
2.3 :white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot, : None
2.3 :sure, hide himself in such reverence. : None
CLAUDIO
2.3 :He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up. : None
DON PEDRO
2.3 :Hath she made her affection known to Benedick? : None
LEONATO
2.3 :No; and swears she never will: that's her torment. : None
CLAUDIO
2.3 :'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall : None
2.3 :I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him : None
2.3 :with scorn, write to him that I love him?' : None
LEONATO
2.3 :This says she now when she is beginning to write to : None
2.3 :him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and : None
2.3 :there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a : None
2.3 :sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all. : None
CLAUDIO
2.3 :Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a : None
2.3 :pretty jest your daughter told us of. : None
LEONATO
2.3 :O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she : None
2.3 :found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet? : None
CLAUDIO
2.3 :That. : None
LEONATO
2.3 :O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence; : None
2.3 :railed at herself, that she should be so immodest : None
2.3 :to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I : None
2.3 :measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I : None
2.3 :should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I : None
2.3 :love him, I should.' : None
CLAUDIO
2.3 :Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs, : None
2.3 :beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O : None
2.3 :sweet Benedick! God give me patience!' : None
LEONATO
2.3 :She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the : None
2.3 :ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter : None
2.3 :is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage : None
2.3 :to herself: it is very true. : None
DON PEDRO
2.3 :It were good that Benedick knew of it by some : None
2.3 :other, if she will not discover it. : None
CLAUDIO
2.3 :To what end? He would make but a sport of it and : None
2.3 :torment the poor lady worse. : None
DON PEDRO
2.3 :An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an : None
2.3 :excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion, : None
2.3 :she is virtuous. : None
CLAUDIO
2.3 :And she is exceeding wise. : None
DON PEDRO
2.3 :In every thing but in loving Benedick. : None
LEONATO
2.3 :O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender : None
2.3 :a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath : None
2.3 :the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just : None
2.3 :cause, being her uncle and her guardian. : None
DON PEDRO
2.3 :I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would : None
2.3 :have daffed all other respects and made her half : None
2.3 :myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear : None
2.3 :what a' will say. : None
LEONATO
2.3 :Were it good, think you? : None
CLAUDIO
2.3 :Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she : None
2.3 :will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere : None
2.3 :she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo : None
2.3 :her, rather than she will bate one breath of her : None
2.3 :accustomed crossness. : None
DON PEDRO
2.3 :She doth well: if she should make tender of her : None
2.3 :love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the : None
2.3 :man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit. : None
CLAUDIO
2.3 :He is a very proper man. : None
DON PEDRO
2.3 :He hath indeed a good outward happiness. : None
CLAUDIO
2.3 :Before God! and, in my mind, very wise. : None
DON PEDRO
2.3 :He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit. : None
CLAUDIO
2.3 :And I take him to be valiant. : None
DON PEDRO
2.3 :As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of : None
2.3 :quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he : None
2.3 :avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes : None
2.3 :them with a most Christian-like fear. : None
LEONATO
2.3 :If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace: : None
2.3 :if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a : None
2.3 :quarrel with fear and trembling. : None
DON PEDRO
2.3 :And so will he do; for the man doth fear God, : None
2.3 :howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests : None
2.3 :he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall : None
2.3 :we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love? : None
CLAUDIO
2.3 :Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with : None
2.3 :good counsel. : None
LEONATO
2.3 :Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first. : None
DON PEDRO
2.3 :Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter: : None
2.3 :let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I : None
2.3 :could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see : None
2.3 :how much he is unworthy so good a lady. : None
LEONATO
2.3 :My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready. : None
CLAUDIO
2.3 :If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never : None
2.3 :trust my expectation. : None
DON PEDRO
2.3 :Let there be the same net spread for her; and that : None
2.3 :must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The : None
2.3 :sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of : None
2.3 :another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the : None
2.3 :scene that I would see, which will be merely a : None
2.3 :dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner. : None
Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO : ["Exeunt - ['DON PEDRO', 'CLAUDIO', 'LEONATO']"] : DON PEDRO
BENEDICK
2.3 :  This can be no trick: the : Coming forward : ['None - []'] : BENEDICK
2.3 :conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of : None
2.3 :this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it : None
2.3 :seems her affections have their full bent. Love me! : None
2.3 :why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured: : None
2.3 :they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive : None
2.3 :the love come from her; they say too that she will : None
2.3 :rather die than give any sign of affection. I did : None
2.3 :never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy : None
2.3 :are they that hear their detractions and can put : None
2.3 :them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a : None
2.3 :truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis : None
2.3 :so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving : None
2.3 :me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor : None
2.3 :no great argument of her folly, for I will be : None
2.3 :horribly in love with her. I may chance have some : None
2.3 :odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me, : None
2.3 :because I have railed so long against marriage: but : None
2.3 :doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat : None
2.3 :in his youth that he cannot endure in his age. : None
2.3 :Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of : None
2.3 :the brain awe a man from the career of his humour? : None
2.3 :No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would : None
2.3 :die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I : None
2.3 :were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day! : None
2.3 :she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in : None
2.3 :her. : None
Enter BEATRICE : ["Enter - ['BEATRICE']"] : BENEDICK
BEATRICE
2.3 :Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner. : None
BENEDICK
2.3 :Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains. : None
BEATRICE
2.3 :I took no more pains for those thanks than you take : None
2.3 :pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would : None
2.3 :not have come. : None
BENEDICK
2.3 :You take pleasure then in the message? : None
BEATRICE
2.3 :Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's : None
2.3 :point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach, : None
2.3 :signior: fare you well. : None
Exit : ['Exit - []'] : BEATRICE
BENEDICK
2.3 :Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in : None
2.3 :to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took : None
2.3 :no more pains for those thanks than you took pains : None
2.3 :to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains : None
2.3 :that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do : None
2.3 :not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not : None
2.3 :love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture. : None

HERO
3.1 :Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor; : None
3.1 :There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice : None
3.1 :Proposing with the prince and Claudio: : None
3.1 :Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula : None
3.1 :Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse : None
3.1 :Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us; : None
3.1 :And bid her steal into the pleached bower, : None
3.1 :Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun, : None
3.1 :Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites, : None
3.1 :Made proud by princes, that advance their pride : None
3.1 :Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her, : None
3.1 :To listen our purpose.  This is thy office; : None
3.1 :Bear thee well in it and leave us alone. : None
MARGARET
3.1 :I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently. : None
Exit : ['Exit - []'] : MARGARET
HERO
3.1 :Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come, : None
3.1 :As we do trace this alley up and down, : None
3.1 :Our talk must only be of Benedick. : None
3.1 :When I do name him, let it be thy part : None
3.1 :To praise him more than ever man did merit: : None
3.1 :My talk to thee must be how Benedick : None
3.1 :Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter : None
3.1 :Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made, : None
3.1 :That only wounds by hearsay. : None
Enter BEATRICE, behind : ["Enter - ['BEATRICE']"] : HERO
3.1 :Now begin; : None
3.1 :For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs : None
3.1 :Close by the ground, to hear our conference. : None
URSULA
3.1 :The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish : None
3.1 :Cut with her golden oars the silver stream, : None
3.1 :And greedily devour the treacherous bait: : None
3.1 :So angle we for Beatrice; who even now : None
3.1 :Is couched in the woodbine coverture. : None
3.1 :Fear you not my part of the dialogue. : None
HERO
3.1 :Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing : None
3.1 :Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it. : None
Approaching the bower : ['None - []'] : HERO
3.1 :No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful; : None
3.1 :I know her spirits are as coy and wild : None
3.1 :As haggerds of the rock. : None
URSULA
3.1 :But are you sure : None
3.1 :That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely? : None
HERO
3.1 :So says the prince and my new-trothed lord. : None
URSULA
3.1 :And did they bid you tell her of it, madam? : None
HERO
3.1 :They did entreat me to acquaint her of it; : None
3.1 :But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick, : None
3.1 :To wish him wrestle with affection, : None
3.1 :And never to let Beatrice know of it. : None
URSULA
3.1 :Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman : None
3.1 :Deserve as full as fortunate a bed : None
3.1 :As ever Beatrice shall couch upon? : None
HERO
3.1 :O god of love! I know he doth deserve : None
3.1 :As much as may be yielded to a man: : None
3.1 :But Nature never framed a woman's heart : None
3.1 :Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice; : None
3.1 :Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes, : None
3.1 :Misprising what they look on, and her wit : None
3.1 :Values itself so highly that to her : None
3.1 :All matter else seems weak: she cannot love, : None
3.1 :Nor take no shape nor project of affection, : None
3.1 :She is so self-endeared. : None
URSULA
3.1 :Sure, I think so; : None
3.1 :And therefore certainly it were not good : None
3.1 :She knew his love, lest she make sport at it. : None
HERO
3.1 :Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man, : None
3.1 :How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured, : None
3.1 :But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced, : None
3.1 :She would swear the gentleman should be her sister; : None
3.1 :If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique, : None
3.1 :Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed; : None
3.1 :If low, an agate very vilely cut; : None
3.1 :If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds; : None
3.1 :If silent, why, a block moved with none. : None
3.1 :So turns she every man the wrong side out : None
3.1 :And never gives to truth and virtue that : None

3.1 :No, not to be so odd and from all fashions : None
3.1 :As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable: : None

3.1 :She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me : None
3.1 :Out of myself, press me to death with wit. : None
3.1 :Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire, : None
3.1 :Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly: : None

HERO
3.1 :No; rather I will go to Benedick : None

CLAUDIO
3.2 :I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll : None

DON PEDRO
3.2 :Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss : None
3.2 :of your marriage as to show a child his new coat : None
3.2 :and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold : None
3.2 :with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown : None
3.2 :of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all : None
3.2 :mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's : None
3.2 :bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at : None
3.2 :him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his : None

CLAUDIO
3.2 :Yet say I, he is in love. : None
DON PEDRO
3.2 :There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be : None
3.2 :a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be : None
3.2 :a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the : None
3.2 :shape of two countries at once, as, a German from : None
3.2 :the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from : None

DON PEDRO
3.2 :Hath any man seen him at the barber's? : None
CLAUDIO
3.2 :No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him, : None
3.2 :and the old ornament of his cheek hath already : None

LEONATO
3.2 :Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard. : None
DON PEDRO
3.2 :Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him : None

CLAUDIO
3.2 :That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love. : None
DON PEDRO
3.2 :The greatest note of it is his melancholy. : None
CLAUDIO
3.2 :And when was he wont to wash his face? : None
DON PEDRO
3.2 :Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear : None
3.2 :what they say of him. : None
CLAUDIO
3.2 :Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into : None
3.2 :a lute-string and now governed by stops. : None
DON PEDRO

3.2 :Nay, but I know who loves him. : None
DON PEDRO

DON PEDRO

DON JOHN

DON PEDRO
3.2 :Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero: : None
CLAUDIO
3.2 :Disloyal? : None
DON JOHN
3.2 :The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I : None

DOGBERRY
3.3 :Are you good men and true? : None
VERGES
3.3 :Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer : None
3.3 :salvation, body and soul. : None
DOGBERRY
3.3 :Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if : None
3.3 :they should have any allegiance in them, being : None
3.3 :chosen for the prince's watch. : None
VERGES
3.3 :Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry. : None
DOGBERRY
3.3 :First, who think you the most desertless man to be : None
3.3 :constable? : None
FIRST WATCHMAN
3.3 :Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they can : None
3.3 :write and read. : None
DOGBERRY
3.3 :Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed : None
3.3 :you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is : None
3.3 :the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature. : None
SECOND WATCHMAN
3.3 :Both which, master constable,-- : None
DOGBERRY
3.3 :You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, : None
3.3 :for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make : None
3.3 :no boast of it; and for your writing and reading, : None
3.3 :let that appear when there is no need of such : None
3.3 :vanity. You are thought here to be the most : None
3.3 :senseless and fit man for the constable of the : None
3.3 :watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your : None
3.3 :charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are : None
3.3 :to bid any man stand, in the prince's name. : None
SECOND WATCHMAN
3.3 :How if a' will not stand? : None
DOGBERRY
3.3 :Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and : None
3.3 :presently call the rest of the watch together and : None
3.3 :thank God you are rid of a knave. : None
VERGES
3.3 :If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none : None
3.3 :of the prince's subjects. : None
DOGBERRY
3.3 :True, and they are to meddle with none but the : None
3.3 :prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in : None
3.3 :the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to : None
3.3 :talk is most tolerable and not to be endured. : None
WATCHMAN
3.3 :We will rather sleep than talk: we know what : None
3.3 :belongs to a watch. : None
DOGBERRY
3.3 :Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet : None
3.3 :watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should : None
3.3 :offend: only, have a care that your bills be not : None
3.3 :stolen. Well, you are to call at all the : None
3.3 :ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed. : None
WATCHMAN
3.3 :How if they will not? : None
DOGBERRY
3.3 :Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if : None
3.3 :they make you not then the better answer, you may : None
3.3 :say they are not the men you took them for. : None
WATCHMAN
3.3 :Well, sir. : None
DOGBERRY
3.3 :If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue : None
3.3 :of your office, to be no true man; and, for such : None
3.3 :kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them, : None
3.3 :why the more is for your honesty. : None
WATCHMAN
3.3 :If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay : None
3.3 :hands on him? : None
DOGBERRY
3.3 :Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they : None
3.3 :that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable : None
3.3 :way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him : None
3.3 :show himself what he is and steal out of your company. : None
VERGES
3.3 :You have been always called a merciful man, partner. : None
DOGBERRY
3.3 :Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more : None
3.3 :a man who hath any honesty in him. : None
VERGES
3.3 :If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call : None
3.3 :to the nurse and bid her still it. : None
WATCHMAN
3.3 :How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us? : None
DOGBERRY
3.3 :Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake : None
3.3 :her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her : None
3.3 :lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats. : None
VERGES
3.3 :'Tis very true. : None
DOGBERRY
3.3 :This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, are : None
3.3 :to present the prince's own person: if you meet the : None
3.3 :prince in the night, you may stay him. : None
VERGES
3.3 :Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot. : None
DOGBERRY
3.3 :Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows : None
3.3 :the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without : None
3.3 :the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought : None
3.3 :to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a : None
3.3 :man against his will. : None
VERGES
3.3 :By'r lady, I think it be so. : None
DOGBERRY
3.3 :Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be : None
3.3 :any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your : None
3.3 :fellows' counsels and your own; and good night. : None
3.3 :Come, neighbour. : None
WATCHMAN
3.3 :Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here : None
3.3 :upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed. : None
DOGBERRY
3.3 :One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch : None
3.3 :about Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being : None
3.3 :there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night. : None

CONRADE
3.3 :I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forward : None

BORACHIO
3.3 :Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, for : None

WATCHMAN
3.3 :  Some treason, masters: yet stand close. : Aside : ['Aside - []'] : WATCHMAN
BORACHIO
3.3 :Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats. : None
CONRADE
3.3 :Is it possible that any villany should be so dear? : None
BORACHIO
3.3 :Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any : None
3.3 :villany should be so rich; for when rich villains : None
3.3 :have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what : None
3.3 :price they will. : None
CONRADE
3.3 :I wonder at it. : None
BORACHIO
3.3 :That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that : None
3.3 :the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is : None
3.3 :nothing to a man. : None
CONRADE
3.3 :Yes, it is apparel. : None
BORACHIO
3.3 :I mean, the fashion. : None
CONRADE
3.3 :Yes, the fashion is the fashion. : None
BORACHIO
3.3 :Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But : None

3.3 :is? : None
WATCHMAN
3.3 :  I know that Deformed; a' has been a vile : Aside : ['Aside - []'] : WATCHMAN

BORACHIO
3.3 :Didst thou not hear somebody? : None
CONRADE
3.3 :No; 'twas the vane on the house. : None
BORACHIO
3.3 :Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this : None
3.3 :fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot : None
3.3 :bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty? : None
3.3 :sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers : None
3.3 :in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's : None
3.3 :priests in the old church-window, sometime like the : None
3.3 :shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry, : None
3.3 :where his codpiece seems as massy as his club? : None
CONRADE
3.3 :All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears : None
3.3 :out more apparel than the man. But art not thou : None
3.3 :thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast : None
3.3 :shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion? : None
BORACHIO
3.3 :Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night : None

3.3 :planted and placed and possessed by my master Don : None
3.3 :John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter. : None
CONRADE
3.3 :And thought they Margaret was Hero? : None
BORACHIO
3.3 :Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the : None
3.3 :devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly : None
3.3 :by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by : None
3.3 :the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly : None
3.3 :by my villany, which did confirm any slander that : None
3.3 :Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore : None
3.3 :he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning : None
3.3 :at the temple, and there, before the whole : None

3.3 :and send her home again without a husband. : None
FIRST WATCHMAN

4.1 :And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire, : None
4.1 :To burn the errors that these princes hold : None
4.1 :Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool; : None
4.1 :Trust not my reading nor my observations, : None
4.1 :Which with experimental seal doth warrant : None
4.1 :The tenor of my book; trust not my age, : None
4.1 :My reverence, calling, nor divinity, : None
4.1 :If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here : None
4.1 :Under some biting error. : None
LEONATO
4.1 :Friar, it cannot be. : None
4.1 :Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left : None
4.1 :Is that she will not add to her damnation : None

FRIAR FRANCIS
4.1 :There is some strange misprision in the princes. : None
BENEDICK
4.1 :Two of them have the very bent of honour; : None

4.1 :The practise of it lives in John the bastard, : None
4.1 :Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies. : None
LEONATO
4.1 :I know not. If they speak but truth of her, : None
4.1 :These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour, : None
4.1 :The proudest of them shall well hear of it. : None
4.1 :Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine, : None
4.1 :Nor age so eat up my invention, : None
4.1 :Nor fortune made such havoc of my means, : None
4.1 :Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends, : None
4.1 :But they shall find, awaked in such a kind, : None
4.1 :Both strength of limb and policy of mind, : None
4.1 :Ability in means and choice of friends, : None
4.1 :To quit me of them throughly. : None
FRIAR FRANCIS
4.1 :Pause awhile, : None
4.1 :And let my counsel sway you in this case. : None
4.1 :Your daughter here the princes left for dead: : None
4.1 :Let her awhile be secretly kept in, : None
4.1 :And publish it that she is dead indeed; : None
4.1 :Maintain a mourning ostentation : None
4.1 :And on your family's old monument : None
4.1 :Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites : None
4.1 :That appertain unto a burial. : None
LEONATO
4.1 :What shall become of this? what will this do? : None
FRIAR FRANCIS
4.1 :Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf : None
4.1 :Change slander to remorse; that is some good: : None
4.1 :But not for that dream I on this strange course, : None
4.1 :But on this travail look for greater birth. : None
4.1 :She dying, as it must so be maintain'd, : None
4.1 :Upon the instant that she was accused, : None
4.1 :Shall be lamented, pitied and excused : None
4.1 :Of every hearer: for it so falls out : None
4.1 :That what we have we prize not to the worth : None
4.1 :Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost, : None
4.1 :Why, then we rack the value, then we find : None
4.1 :The virtue that possession would not show us : None
4.1 :Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio: : None
4.1 :When he shall hear she died upon his words, : None
4.1 :The idea of her life shall sweetly creep : None
4.1 :Into his study of imagination, : None
4.1 :And every lovely organ of her life : None
4.1 :Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit, : None
4.1 :More moving-delicate and full of life, : None
4.1 :Into the eye and prospect of his soul, : None
4.1 :Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn, : None
4.1 :If ever love had interest in his liver, : None
4.1 :And wish he had not so accused her, : None
4.1 :No, though he thought his accusation true. : None
4.1 :Let this be so, and doubt not but success : None
4.1 :Will fashion the event in better shape : None
4.1 :Than I can lay it down in likelihood. : None
4.1 :But if all aim but this be levell'd false, : None
4.1 :The supposition of the lady's death : None
4.1 :Will quench the wonder of her infamy: : None
4.1 :And if it sort not well, you may conceal her, : None
4.1 :As best befits her wounded reputation, : None
4.1 :In some reclusive and religious life, : None
4.1 :Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries. : None
BENEDICK
4.1 :Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you: : None
4.1 :And though you know my inwardness and love : None
4.1 :Is very much unto the prince and Claudio, : None
4.1 :Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this : None
4.1 :As secretly and justly as your soul : None
4.1 :Should with your body. : None
LEONATO
4.1 :Being that I flow in grief, : None
4.1 :The smallest twine may lead me. : None
FRIAR FRANCIS
4.1 :'Tis well consented: presently away; : None

4.1 :It is a man's office, but not yours. : None
BENEDICK
4.1 :I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is : None
4.1 :not that strange? : None

5.1 :there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus : None

CLAUDIO

5.1 :hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank : None
5.1 :you: I must discontinue your company: your brother : None
5.1 :the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among : None

5.1 :the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's : None

5.1 :marry her: my villany they have upon record; which : None
5.1 :I had rather seal with my death than repeat over : None

CLAUDIO
5.1 :I know not how to pray your patience; : None

DON PEDRO

5.1 :That were impossible: but, I pray you both, : None

5.1 :How innocent she died; and if your love : None
5.1 :Can labour ought in sad invention, : None
5.1 :Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb : None

MARGARET
5.2 :Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty? : None
BENEDICK
5.2 :In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living : None
5.2 :shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou : None
5.2 :deservest it. : None
MARGARET
5.2 :To have no man come over me! why, shall I always : None
5.2 :keep below stairs? : None
BENEDICK
5.2 :Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches. : None
MARGARET
5.2 :And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit, : None
5.2 :but hurt not. : None
BENEDICK
5.2 :A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a : None
5.2 :woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice: I give : None

MARGARET
5.2 :Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own. : None
BENEDICK
5.2 :If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the : None

5.2 :How pitiful I deserve,-- : None
5.2 :I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the good : None
5.2 :swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and : None
5.2 :a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers, : None
5.2 :whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a : None
5.2 :blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned : None
5.2 :over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I : None
5.2 :cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can find : None
5.2 :out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent : None
5.2 :rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for, : None
5.2 :'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominous : None

5.2 :Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me. : None
BENEDICK
5.2 :O, stay but till then! : None
BEATRICE
5.2 :'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere : None
5.2 :I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with : None
5.2 :knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio. : None
BENEDICK
5.2 :Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee. : None
BEATRICE
5.2 :Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but : None
5.2 :foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I : None
5.2 :will depart unkissed. : None
BENEDICK
5.2 :Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense, : None
5.2 :so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee : None
5.2 :plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and either : None
5.2 :I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe : None
5.2 :him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me for : None
5.2 :which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me? : None
BEATRICE
5.2 :For them all together; which maintained so politic : None
5.2 :a state of evil that they will not admit any good : None
5.2 :part to intermingle with them. But for which of my : None
5.2 :good parts did you first suffer love for me? : None
BENEDICK
5.2 :Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love : None
5.2 :indeed, for I love thee against my will. : None
BEATRICE
5.2 :In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart! : None
5.2 :If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for : None
5.2 :yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates. : None
BENEDICK
5.2 :Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably. : None
BEATRICE
5.2 :It appears not in this confession: there's not one : None
5.2 :wise man among twenty that will praise himself. : None
BENEDICK
5.2 :An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in : None
5.2 :the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect : None
5.2 :in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live : None
5.2 :no longer in monument than the bell rings and the : None
5.2 :widow weeps. : None
BEATRICE
5.2 :And how long is that, think you? : None
BENEDICK
5.2 :Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in : None
5.2 :rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the : None
5.2 :wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no : None
5.2 :impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his : None
5.2 :own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for : None
5.2 :praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is : None
5.2 :praiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin? : None
BEATRICE
5.2 :Very ill. : None
BENEDICK
5.2 :And how do you? : None
BEATRICE

5.2 :fed and gone. Will you come presently? : None
BEATRICE
5.2 :Will you go hear this news, signior? : None

5.4 :nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do : None
5.4 :purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any : None
5.4 :purpose that the world can say against it; and : None
5.4 :therefore never flout at me for what I have said : None
5.4 :against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my : None
5.4 :conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to : None

5.4 :kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin. : None
CLAUDIO
5.4 :I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice, : None
5.4 :that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single : None
