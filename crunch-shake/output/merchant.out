Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO : ["Enter - ['ANTONIO', 'SALARINO', 'SALANIO']"] : None
ANTONIO
1.1 :In sooth, I know not why I am so sad: : None
1.1 :It wearies me; you say it wearies you; : None
1.1 :But how I caught it, found it, or came by it, : None
1.1 :What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born, : None
1.1 :I am to learn; : None
1.1 :And such a want-wit sadness makes of me, : None
1.1 :That I have much ado to know myself. : None
SALARINO
1.1 :Your mind is tossing on the ocean; : None
1.1 :There, where your argosies with portly sail, : None
1.1 :Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood, : None
1.1 :Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea, : None
1.1 :Do overpeer the petty traffickers, : None
1.1 :That curtsy to them, do them reverence, : None
1.1 :As they fly by them with their woven wings. : None
SALANIO
1.1 :Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth, : None
1.1 :The better part of my affections would : None
1.1 :Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still : None
1.1 :Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind, : None
1.1 :Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads; : None
1.1 :And every object that might make me fear : None
1.1 :Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt : None
1.1 :Would make me sad. : None
SALARINO
1.1 :                  My wind cooling my broth : None
1.1 :Would blow me to an ague, when I thought : None
1.1 :What harm a wind too great at sea might do. : None
1.1 :I should not see the sandy hour-glass run, : None
1.1 :But I should think of shallows and of flats, : None
1.1 :And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand, : None
1.1 :Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs : None
1.1 :To kiss her burial. Should I go to church : None
1.1 :And see the holy edifice of stone, : None
1.1 :And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks, : None
1.1 :Which touching but my gentle vessel's side, : None
1.1 :Would scatter all her spices on the stream, : None
1.1 :Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks, : None
1.1 :And, in a word, but even now worth this, : None
1.1 :And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought : None
1.1 :To think on this, and shall I lack the thought : None
1.1 :That such a thing bechanced would make me sad? : None
1.1 :But tell not me; I know, Antonio : None
1.1 :Is sad to think upon his merchandise. : None
ANTONIO
1.1 :Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it, : None
1.1 :My ventures are not in one bottom trusted, : None
1.1 :Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate : None
1.1 :Upon the fortune of this present year: : None
1.1 :Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad. : None
SALARINO
1.1 :Why, then you are in love. : None
ANTONIO
1.1 :Fie, fie! : None
SALARINO
1.1 :Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad, : None
1.1 :Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy : None
1.1 :For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry, : None
1.1 :Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus, : None
1.1 :Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time: : None
1.1 :Some that will evermore peep through their eyes : None
1.1 :And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper, : None
1.1 :And other of such vinegar aspect : None
1.1 :That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile, : None
1.1 :Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable. : None
Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO : ["Enter - ['BASSANIO', 'LORENZO', 'GRATIANO']"] : SALARINO
SALANIO
1.1 :Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman, : None
1.1 :Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well: : None
1.1 :We leave you now with better company. : None
SALARINO
1.1 :I would have stay'd till I had made you merry, : None
1.1 :If worthier friends had not prevented me. : None
ANTONIO
1.1 :Your worth is very dear in my regard. : None
1.1 :I take it, your own business calls on you : None
1.1 :And you embrace the occasion to depart. : None
SALARINO
1.1 :Good morrow, my good lords. : None
BASSANIO
1.1 :Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when? : None
1.1 :You grow exceeding strange: must it be so? : None
SALARINO
1.1 :We'll make our leisures to attend on yours. : None
Exeunt Salarino and Salanio : ["Exeunt - ['SALARINO', 'SALANIO']"] : SALARINO
LORENZO
1.1 :My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio, : None
1.1 :We two will leave you: but at dinner-time, : None
1.1 :I pray you, have in mind where we must meet. : None
BASSANIO
1.1 :I will not fail you. : None
GRATIANO
1.1 :You look not well, Signior Antonio; : None
1.1 :You have too much respect upon the world: : None
1.1 :They lose it that do buy it with much care: : None
1.1 :Believe me, you are marvellously changed. : None
ANTONIO
1.1 :I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano; : None
1.1 :A stage where every man must play a part, : None
1.1 :And mine a sad one. : None
GRATIANO
1.1 :Let me play the fool: : None
1.1 :With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come, : None
1.1 :And let my liver rather heat with wine : None
1.1 :Than my heart cool with mortifying groans. : None
1.1 :Why should a man, whose blood is warm within, : None
1.1 :Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster? : None
1.1 :Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice : None
1.1 :By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio-- : None
1.1 :I love thee, and it is my love that speaks-- : None
1.1 :There are a sort of men whose visages : None
1.1 :Do cream and mantle like a standing pond, : None
1.1 :And do a wilful stillness entertain, : None
1.1 :With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion : None
1.1 :Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit, : None
1.1 :As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle, : None
1.1 :And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!' : None
1.1 :O my Antonio, I do know of these : None
1.1 :That therefore only are reputed wise : None
1.1 :For saying nothing; when, I am very sure, : None
1.1 :If they should speak, would almost damn those ears, : None
1.1 :Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools. : None
1.1 :I'll tell thee more of this another time: : None
1.1 :But fish not, with this melancholy bait, : None
1.1 :For this fool gudgeon, this opinion. : None
1.1 :Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile: : None
1.1 :I'll end my exhortation after dinner. : None
LORENZO
1.1 :Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time: : None
1.1 :I must be one of these same dumb wise men, : None
1.1 :For Gratiano never lets me speak. : None
GRATIANO
1.1 :Well, keep me company but two years moe, : None
1.1 :Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue. : None
ANTONIO
1.1 :Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear. : None
GRATIANO
1.1 :Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable : None
1.1 :In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible. : None
Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO : ["Exeunt - ['GRATIANO', 'LORENZO']"] : GRATIANO
ANTONIO
1.1 :Is that any thing now? : None
BASSANIO
1.1 :Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more : None
1.1 :than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two : None
1.1 :grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you : None
1.1 :shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you : None
1.1 :have them, they are not worth the search. : None
ANTONIO
1.1 :Well, tell me now what lady is the same : None
1.1 :To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage, : None
1.1 :That you to-day promised to tell me of? : None
BASSANIO
1.1 :'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio, : None
1.1 :How much I have disabled mine estate, : None
1.1 :By something showing a more swelling port : None
1.1 :Than my faint means would grant continuance: : None
1.1 :Nor do I now make moan to be abridged : None
1.1 :From such a noble rate; but my chief care : None
1.1 :Is to come fairly off from the great debts : None
1.1 :Wherein my time something too prodigal : None
1.1 :Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio, : None
1.1 :I owe the most, in money and in love, : None
1.1 :And from your love I have a warranty : None
1.1 :To unburden all my plots and purposes : None
1.1 :How to get clear of all the debts I owe. : None
ANTONIO
1.1 :I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it; : None
1.1 :And if it stand, as you yourself still do, : None
1.1 :Within the eye of honour, be assured, : None
1.1 :My purse, my person, my extremest means, : None
1.1 :Lie all unlock'd to your occasions. : None
BASSANIO
1.1 :In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft, : None
1.1 :I shot his fellow of the self-same flight : None
1.1 :The self-same way with more advised watch, : None
1.1 :To find the other forth, and by adventuring both : None
1.1 :I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof, : None
1.1 :Because what follows is pure innocence. : None
1.1 :I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth, : None
1.1 :That which I owe is lost; but if you please : None
1.1 :To shoot another arrow that self way : None
1.1 :Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt, : None
1.1 :As I will watch the aim, or to find both : None
1.1 :Or bring your latter hazard back again : None
1.1 :And thankfully rest debtor for the first. : None
ANTONIO
1.1 :You know me well, and herein spend but time : None
1.1 :To wind about my love with circumstance; : None
1.1 :And out of doubt you do me now more wrong : None
1.1 :In making question of my uttermost : None
1.1 :Than if you had made waste of all I have: : None
1.1 :Then do but say to me what I should do : None
1.1 :That in your knowledge may by me be done, : None
1.1 :And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak. : None
BASSANIO
1.1 :In Belmont is a lady richly left; : None
1.1 :And she is fair, and, fairer than that word, : None
1.1 :Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes : None
1.1 :I did receive fair speechless messages: : None
1.1 :Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued : None
1.1 :To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia: : None
1.1 :Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth, : None
1.1 :For the four winds blow in from every coast : None
1.1 :Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks : None
1.1 :Hang on her temples like a golden fleece; : None
1.1 :Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand, : None
1.1 :And many Jasons come in quest of her. : None
1.1 :O my Antonio, had I but the means : None
1.1 :To hold a rival place with one of them, : None
1.1 :I have a mind presages me such thrift, : None
1.1 :That I should questionless be fortunate! : None
ANTONIO
1.1 :Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea; : None
1.1 :Neither have I money nor commodity : None
1.1 :To raise a present sum: therefore go forth; : None
1.1 :Try what my credit can in Venice do: : None
1.1 :That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost, : None
1.1 :To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia. : None
1.1 :Go, presently inquire, and so will I, : None
1.1 :Where money is, and I no question make : None
1.1 :To have it of my trust or for my sake. : None
Exeunt : ['Exeunt - []'] : ANTONIO
1.1 :SCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house. : None
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA : ["Enter - ['PORTIA', 'NERISSA']"] : ANTONIO
PORTIA
1.1 :By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of : None
1.1 :this great world. : None
NERISSA
1.1 :You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in : None
1.1 :the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and : None
1.1 :yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit : None
1.1 :with too much as they that starve with nothing. It : None
1.1 :is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the : None
1.1 :mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but : None
1.1 :competency lives longer. : None
PORTIA
1.1 :Good sentences and well pronounced. : None
NERISSA
1.1 :They would be better, if well followed. : None
PORTIA
1.1 :If to do were as easy as to know what were good to : None
1.1 :do, chapels had been churches and poor men's : None
1.1 :cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that : None
1.1 :follows his own instructions: I can easier teach : None
1.1 :twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the : None
1.1 :twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may : None
1.1 :devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps : None
1.1 :o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the : None
1.1 :youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the : None
1.1 :cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to : None
1.1 :choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may : None
1.1 :neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I : None
1.1 :dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed : None
1.1 :by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, : None
1.1 :Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none? : None
NERISSA
1.1 :Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their : None
1.1 :death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery, : None
1.1 :that he hath devised in these three chests of gold, : None
1.1 :silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning : None
1.1 :chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any : None
1.1 :rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what : None
1.1 :warmth is there in your affection towards any of : None
1.1 :these princely suitors that are already come? : None
PORTIA
1.1 :I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest : None
1.1 :them, I will describe them; and, according to my : None
1.1 :description, level at my affection. : None
NERISSA
1.1 :First, there is the Neapolitan prince. : None
PORTIA
1.1 :Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but : None
1.1 :talk of his horse; and he makes it a great : None
1.1 :appropriation to his own good parts, that he can : None
1.1 :shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his : None
1.1 :mother played false with a smith. : None
NERISSA
1.1 :Then there is the County Palatine. : None
PORTIA
1.1 :He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you : None
1.1 :will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and : None
1.1 :smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping : None
1.1 :philosopher when he grows old, being so full of : None
1.1 :unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be : None
1.1 :married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth : None
1.1 :than to either of these. God defend me from these : None
1.1 :two! : None
NERISSA
1.1 :How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon? : None
PORTIA
1.1 :God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man. : None
1.1 :In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but, : None
1.1 :he! why, he hath a horse better than the : None
1.1 :Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than : None
1.1 :the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a : None
1.1 :throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will : None
1.1 :fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I : None
1.1 :should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me : None
1.1 :I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I : None
1.1 :shall never requite him. : None
NERISSA
1.1 :What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron : None
1.1 :of England? : None
PORTIA
1.1 :You know I say nothing to him, for he understands : None
1.1 :not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French, : None
1.1 :nor Italian, and you will come into the court and : None
1.1 :swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English. : None
1.1 :He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can : None
1.1 :converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited! : None
1.1 :I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round : None
1.1 :hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his : None
1.1 :behavior every where. : None
NERISSA
1.1 :What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour? : None
PORTIA
1.1 :That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he : None
1.1 :borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and : None
1.1 :swore he would pay him again when he was able: I : None
1.1 :think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed : None
1.1 :under for another. : None
NERISSA
1.1 :How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew? : None
PORTIA
1.1 :Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and : None
1.1 :most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when : None
1.1 :he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and : None
1.1 :when he is worst, he is little better than a beast: : None
1.1 :and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall : None
1.1 :make shift to go without him. : None
NERISSA
1.1 :If he should offer to choose, and choose the right : None
1.1 :casket, you should refuse to perform your father's : None
1.1 :will, if you should refuse to accept him. : None
PORTIA
1.1 :Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a : None
1.1 :deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket, : None
1.1 :for if the devil be within and that temptation : None
1.1 :without, I know he will choose it. I will do any : None
1.1 :thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge. : None
NERISSA
1.1 :You need not fear, lady, the having any of these : None
1.1 :lords: they have acquainted me with their : None
1.1 :determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their : None
1.1 :home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless : None
1.1 :you may be won by some other sort than your father's : None
1.1 :imposition depending on the caskets. : None
PORTIA
1.1 :If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as : None
1.1 :chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner : None
1.1 :of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers : None
1.1 :are so reasonable, for there is not one among them : None
1.1 :but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant : None
1.1 :them a fair departure. : None
NERISSA
1.1 :Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a : None
1.1 :Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither : None
1.1 :in company of the Marquis of Montferrat? : None
PORTIA
1.1 :Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called. : None
NERISSA
1.1 :True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish : None
1.1 :eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady. : None
PORTIA
1.1 :I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of : None
1.1 :thy praise. : None
Enter a Serving-man : ['Enter - []'] : PORTIA
1.1 :How now! what news? : None
SERVANT
1.1 :The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take : None
1.1 :their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a : None
1.1 :fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the : None
1.1 :prince his master will be here to-night. : None
PORTIA
1.1 :If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a : None
1.1 :heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should : None
1.1 :be glad of his approach: if he have the condition : None
1.1 :of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had : None
1.1 :rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come, : None
1.1 :Nerissa. Sirrah, go before. : None
1.1 :Whiles we shut the gates : None
1.1 :upon one wooer, another knocks at the door. : None

Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK : ["Enter - ['BASSANIO', 'SHYLOCK']"] : PORTIA
SHYLOCK
1.3 :Three thousand ducats; well. : None
BASSANIO
1.3 :Ay, sir, for three months. : None
SHYLOCK
1.3 :For three months; well. : None
BASSANIO
1.3 :For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound. : None
SHYLOCK
1.3 :Antonio shall become bound; well. : None
BASSANIO
1.3 :May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I : None
1.3 :know your answer? : None
SHYLOCK
1.3 :Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound. : None
BASSANIO
1.3 :Your answer to that. : None
SHYLOCK
1.3 :Antonio is a good man. : None
BASSANIO
1.3 :Have you heard any imputation to the contrary? : None
SHYLOCK
1.3 :Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a : None
1.3 :good man is to have you understand me that he is : None
1.3 :sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he : None
1.3 :hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the : None
1.3 :Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he : None
1.3 :hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and : None
1.3 :other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships : None
1.3 :are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats : None
1.3 :and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I : None
1.3 :mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters, : None
1.3 :winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding, : None
1.3 :sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may : None
1.3 :take his bond. : None
BASSANIO
1.3 :Be assured you may. : None
SHYLOCK
1.3 :I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured, : None
1.3 :I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio? : None
BASSANIO
1.3 :If it please you to dine with us. : None
SHYLOCK
1.3 :Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which : None
1.3 :your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I : None
1.3 :will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you, : None
1.3 :walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat : None
1.3 :with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What : None
1.3 :news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here? : None
Enter ANTONIO : ["Enter - ['ANTONIO']"] : SHYLOCK
BASSANIO
1.3 :This is Signior Antonio. : None
SHYLOCK
1.3 :  How like a fawning publican he looks! : Aside : ['Aside - []'] : SHYLOCK
1.3 :I hate him for he is a Christian, : None
1.3 :But more for that in low simplicity : None
1.3 :He lends out money gratis and brings down : None
1.3 :The rate of usance here with us in Venice. : None
1.3 :If I can catch him once upon the hip, : None
1.3 :I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him. : None
1.3 :He hates our sacred nation, and he rails, : None
1.3 :Even there where merchants most do congregate, : None
1.3 :On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift, : None
1.3 :Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe, : None
1.3 :If I forgive him! : None
BASSANIO
1.3 :                  Shylock, do you hear? : None
SHYLOCK
1.3 :I am debating of my present store, : None
1.3 :And, by the near guess of my memory, : None
1.3 :I cannot instantly raise up the gross : None
1.3 :Of full three thousand ducats. What of that? : None
1.3 :Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe, : None
1.3 :Will furnish me. But soft! how many months : None
1.3 :Do you desire? : None
To ANTONIO : ["To - ['ANTONIO']"] : SHYLOCK
1.3 :Rest you fair, good signior; : None
1.3 :Your worship was the last man in our mouths. : None
ANTONIO
1.3 :Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow : None
1.3 :By taking nor by giving of excess, : None
1.3 :Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend, : None
1.3 :I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd : None
1.3 :How much ye would? : None
SHYLOCK
1.3 :                  Ay, ay, three thousand ducats. : None
ANTONIO
1.3 :And for three months. : None
SHYLOCK
1.3 :I had forgot; three months; you told me so. : None
1.3 :Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you; : None
1.3 :Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow : None
1.3 :Upon advantage. : None
ANTONIO
1.3 :                  I do never use it. : None

3.2 :And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady, : None

3.2 :And then away to Venice to your friend; : None
3.2 :For never shall you lie by Portia's side : None

3.2 :miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is : None
3.2 :very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since : None
3.2 :in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all : None
3.2 :debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but : None
3.2 :see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your : None

4.1 :your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that : None
4.1 :your messenger came, in loving visitation was with : None
4.1 :me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I : None
4.1 :acquainted him with the cause in controversy between : None
4.1 :the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er : None
4.1 :many books together: he is furnished with my : None
4.1 :opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the : None
4.1 :greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes : None
4.1 :with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's : None

SHYLOCK
4.1 :Shylock is my name. : None
PORTIA
4.1 :Of a strange nature is the suit you follow; : None

4.1 :The quality of mercy is not strain'd, : None
4.1 :It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven : None
4.1 :Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest; : None
4.1 :It blesseth him that gives and him that takes: : None

4.1 :Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings; : None
4.1 :But mercy is above this sceptred sway; : None
4.1 :It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, : None
4.1 :It is an attribute to God himself; : None
4.1 :And earthly power doth then show likest God's : None
4.1 :When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew, : None
4.1 :Though justice be thy plea, consider this, : None
4.1 :That, in the course of justice, none of us : None
4.1 :Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy; : None
4.1 :And that same prayer doth teach us all to render : None
4.1 :The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much : None
4.1 :To mitigate the justice of thy plea; : None
4.1 :Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice : None
4.1 :Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there. : None
SHYLOCK

4.1 :On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart: : None
4.1 :If this will not suffice, it must appear : None

4.1 :Shall I lay perjury upon my soul? : None
4.1 :No, not for Venice. : None
PORTIA

4.1 :And lawfully by this the Jew may claim : None
4.1 :A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off : None
4.1 :Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful: : None
4.1 :Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond. : None
SHYLOCK
4.1 :When it is paid according to the tenor. : None
4.1 :It doth appear you are a worthy judge; : None
4.1 :You know the law, your exposition : None
4.1 :Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law, : None
4.1 :Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar, : None
4.1 :Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear : None
4.1 :There is no power in the tongue of man : None
4.1 :To alter me: I stay here on my bond. : None
ANTONIO
4.1 :Most heartily I do beseech the court : None
4.1 :To give the judgment. : None
PORTIA
4.1 :Why then, thus it is: : None
4.1 :You must prepare your bosom for his knife. : None
SHYLOCK
4.1 :O noble judge! O excellent young man! : None
PORTIA
4.1 :For the intent and purpose of the law : None
4.1 :Hath full relation to the penalty, : None

4.1 :So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge? : None
4.1 :'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words. : None
PORTIA

SHYLOCK
4.1 :         I have them ready. : None
PORTIA
4.1 :Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge, : None
4.1 :To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death. : None
SHYLOCK
4.1 :Is it so nominated in the bond? : None
PORTIA
4.1 :It is not so express'd: but what of that? : None
4.1 :'Twere good you do so much for charity. : None
SHYLOCK
4.1 :I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond. : None
PORTIA
4.1 :You, merchant, have you any thing to say? : None
ANTONIO
4.1 :But little: I am arm'd and well prepared. : None
4.1 :Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well! : None
4.1 :Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you; : None
4.1 :For herein Fortune shows herself more kind : None
4.1 :Than is her custom: it is still her use : None

4.1 :Of such misery doth she cut me off. : None
4.1 :Commend me to your honourable wife: : None
4.1 :Tell her the process of Antonio's end; : None
4.1 :Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death; : None

4.1 :Whether Bassanio had not once a love. : None
4.1 :Repent but you that you shall lose your friend, : None
4.1 :And he repents not that he pays your debt; : None

4.1 :Entreat some power to change this currish Jew. : None
NERISSA

4.1 :Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest. : None
GRATIANO
4.1 :O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge! : None

4.1 :But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more : None
4.1 :Or less than a just pound, be it but so much : None
4.1 :As makes it light or heavy in the substance, : None
4.1 :Or the division of the twentieth part : None
4.1 :Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn : None
4.1 :But in the estimation of a hair, : None
4.1 :Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate. : None
GRATIANO
