Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS : ["Enter - ['TROILUS', 'PANDARUS']"] : None
TROILUS
1.1 :Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again: : None
1.1 :Why should I war without the walls of Troy, : None
1.1 :That find such cruel battle here within? : None
1.1 :Each Trojan that is master of his heart, : None
1.1 :Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none. : None
PANDARUS
1.1 :Will this gear ne'er be mended? : None
TROILUS
1.1 :The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength, : None
1.1 :Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant; : None
1.1 :But I am weaker than a woman's tear, : None
1.1 :Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance, : None
1.1 :Less valiant than the virgin in the night : None
1.1 :And skilless as unpractised infancy. : None
PANDARUS
1.1 :Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part, : None
1.1 :I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will : None
1.1 :have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding. : None
TROILUS
1.1 :Have I not tarried? : None
PANDARUS
1.1 :Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry : None
1.1 :the bolting. : None
TROILUS
1.1 :Have I not tarried? : None
PANDARUS
1.1 :Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening. : None
TROILUS
1.1 :Still have I tarried. : None
PANDARUS
1.1 :Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word : None
1.1 :'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the : None
1.1 :heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must : None
1.1 :stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips. : None
TROILUS
1.1 :Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be, : None
1.1 :Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do. : None
1.1 :At Priam's royal table do I sit; : None
1.1 :And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,-- : None
1.1 :So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence? : None
PANDARUS
1.1 :Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw : None
1.1 :her look, or any woman else. : None
TROILUS
1.1 :I was about to tell thee:--when my heart, : None
1.1 :As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain, : None
1.1 :Lest Hector or my father should perceive me, : None
1.1 :I have, as when the sun doth light a storm, : None
1.1 :Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile: : None
1.1 :But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness, : None
1.1 :Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness. : None
PANDARUS
1.1 :An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's-- : None
1.1 :well, go to--there were no more comparison between : None
1.1 :the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I : None
1.1 :would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would : None
1.1 :somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I : None
1.1 :will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but-- : None
TROILUS
1.1 :O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,-- : None
1.1 :When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd, : None
1.1 :Reply not in how many fathoms deep : None
1.1 :They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad : None
1.1 :In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;' : None
1.1 :Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart : None
1.1 :Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice, : None
1.1 :Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand, : None
1.1 :In whose comparison all whites are ink, : None
1.1 :Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure : None
1.1 :The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense : None
1.1 :Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me, : None
1.1 :As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her; : None
1.1 :But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm, : None
1.1 :Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me : None
1.1 :The knife that made it. : None
PANDARUS
1.1 :I speak no more than truth. : None
TROILUS
1.1 :Thou dost not speak so much. : None
PANDARUS
1.1 :Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is: : None
1.1 :if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be : None
1.1 :not, she has the mends in her own hands. : None
TROILUS
1.1 :Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus! : None
PANDARUS
1.1 :I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of : None
1.1 :her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and : None
1.1 :between, but small thanks for my labour. : None
TROILUS
1.1 :What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me? : None
PANDARUS
1.1 :Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair : None
1.1 :as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as : None
1.1 :fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care : None
1.1 :I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me. : None
TROILUS
1.1 :Say I she is not fair? : None
PANDARUS
1.1 :I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to : None
1.1 :stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so : None
1.1 :I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part, : None
1.1 :I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter. : None
TROILUS
1.1 :Pandarus,-- : None
PANDARUS
1.1 :Not I. : None
TROILUS
1.1 :Sweet Pandarus,-- : None
PANDARUS
1.1 :Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I : None
1.1 :found it, and there an end. : None
Exit PANDARUS. An alarum : ["Exit - ['PANDARUS']", 'None - []'] : PANDARUS
TROILUS
1.1 :Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds! : None
1.1 :Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair, : None
1.1 :When with your blood you daily paint her thus. : None
1.1 :I cannot fight upon this argument; : None
1.1 :It is too starved a subject for my sword. : None
1.1 :But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me! : None
1.1 :I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar; : None
1.1 :And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo. : None
1.1 :As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit. : None
1.1 :Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love, : None
1.1 :What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we? : None
1.1 :Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl: : None
1.1 :Between our Ilium and where she resides, : None
1.1 :Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood, : None
1.1 :Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar : None
1.1 :Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark. : None
Alarum. Enter AENEAS : ['None - []', "Enter - ['AENEAS']"] : TROILUS
AENEAS
1.1 :How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield? : None
TROILUS
1.1 :Because not there: this woman's answer sorts, : None
1.1 :For womanish it is to be from thence. : None
1.1 :What news, AEneas, from the field to-day? : None
AENEAS
1.1 :That Paris is returned home and hurt. : None
TROILUS
1.1 :By whom, AEneas? : None
AENEAS
1.1 :                  Troilus, by Menelaus. : None
TROILUS
1.1 :Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn; : None
1.1 :Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn. : None
Alarum : ['None - []'] : TROILUS
AENEAS
1.1 :Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day! : None
TROILUS
1.1 :Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.' : None
1.1 :But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither? : None
AENEAS
1.1 :In all swift haste. : None
TROILUS
1.1 :Come, go we then together. : None

CRESSIDA
1.2 :Who were those went by? : None
ALEXANDER
1.2 :Queen Hecuba and Helen. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :And whither go they? : None
ALEXANDER
1.2 :Up to the eastern tower, : None
1.2 :Whose height commands as subject all the vale, : None
1.2 :To see the battle. Hector, whose patience : None
1.2 :Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved: : None
1.2 :He chid Andromache and struck his armourer, : None
1.2 :And, like as there were husbandry in war, : None
1.2 :Before the sun rose he was harness'd light, : None
1.2 :And to the field goes he; where every flower : None
1.2 :Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw : None
1.2 :In Hector's wrath. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :                  What was his cause of anger? : None
ALEXANDER
1.2 :The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks : None
1.2 :A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector; : None
1.2 :They call him Ajax. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Good; and what of him? : None
ALEXANDER
1.2 :They say he is a very man per se, : None
1.2 :And stands alone. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs. : None
ALEXANDER
1.2 :This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their : None
1.2 :particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion, : None
1.2 :churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man : None
1.2 :into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his : None
1.2 :valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with : None
1.2 :discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he : None
1.2 :hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he : None
1.2 :carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without : None
1.2 :cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the : None
1.2 :joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint : None
1.2 :that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use, : None
1.2 :or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :But how should this man, that makes : None
1.2 :me smile, make Hector angry? : None
ALEXANDER
1.2 :They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and : None
1.2 :struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath : None
1.2 :ever since kept Hector fasting and waking. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Who comes here? : None
ALEXANDER
1.2 :Madam, your uncle Pandarus. : None
Enter PANDARUS : ["Enter - ['PANDARUS']"] : ALEXANDER
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Hector's a gallant man. : None
ALEXANDER
1.2 :As may be in the world, lady. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :What's that? what's that? : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Good morrow, uncle Pandarus. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of? : None
1.2 :Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When : None
1.2 :were you at Ilium? : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :This morning, uncle. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector : None
1.2 :armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not : None
1.2 :up, was she? : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Hector was gone, but Helen was not up. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Even so: Hector was stirring early. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :That were we talking of, and of his anger. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Was he angry? : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :So he says here. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay : None
1.2 :about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's : None
1.2 :Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take : None
1.2 :heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :What, is he angry too? : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :O Jupiter! there's no comparison. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a : None
1.2 :man if you see him? : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Well, I say Troilus is Troilus. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :'Tis just to each of them; he is himself. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :So he is. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Condition, I had gone barefoot to India. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :He is not Hector. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were : None
1.2 :himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend : None
1.2 :or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were : None
1.2 :in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Excuse me. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :He is elder. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Pardon me, pardon me. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another : None
1.2 :tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not : None
1.2 :have his wit this year. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :He shall not need it, if he have his own. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Nor his qualities. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :No matter. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Nor his beauty. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :'Twould not become him; his own's better. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :You have no judgment, niece: Helen : None
1.2 :herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for : None
1.2 :a brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,-- : None
1.2 :not brown neither,-- : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :No, but brown. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :To say the truth, true and not true. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :She praised his complexion above Paris. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Why, Paris hath colour enough. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :So he has. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised : None
1.2 :him above, his complexion is higher than his; he : None
1.2 :having colour enough, and the other higher, is too : None
1.2 :flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as : None
1.2 :lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for : None
1.2 :a copper nose. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Then she's a merry Greek indeed. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other : None
1.2 :day into the compassed window,--and, you know, he : None
1.2 :has not past three or four hairs on his chin,-- : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his : None
1.2 :particulars therein to a total. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within : None
1.2 :three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Is he so young a man and so old a lifter? : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came : None
1.2 :and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin-- : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Juno have mercy! how came it cloven? : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling : None
1.2 :becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :O, he smiles valiantly. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Does he not? : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen : None
1.2 :loves Troilus,-- : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll : None
1.2 :prove it so. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem : None
1.2 :an addle egg. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle : None
1.2 :head, you would eat chickens i' the shell. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled : None
1.2 :his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I : None
1.2 :must needs confess,-- : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Without the rack. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed : None
1.2 :that her eyes ran o'er. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :With mill-stones. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :And Cassandra laughed. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :But there was more temperate fire under the pot of : None
1.2 :her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too? : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :And Hector laughed. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :At what was all this laughing? : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed : None
1.2 :too. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :What was his answer? : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your : None
1.2 :chin, and one of them is white. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :This is her question. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and : None
1.2 :fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white : None
1.2 :hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.' : None
1.2 :'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris, : None
1.2 :my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't : None
1.2 :out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing! : None
1.2 :and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the : None
1.2 :rest so laughed, that it passed. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :So let it now; for it has been while going by. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :So I do. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twere : None
1.2 :a man born in April. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle : None
1.2 :against May. : None
A retreat sounded : ['None - []'] : CRESSIDA
PANDARUS
1.2 :Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we : None
1.2 :stand up here, and see them as they pass toward : None
1.2 :Ilium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :At your pleasure. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may : None
1.2 :see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their : None
1.2 :names as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Speak not so loud. : None
AENEAS passes : ["None - ['AENEAS']"] : CRESSIDA
PANDARUS

1.2 :the flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but mark : None
1.2 :Troilus; you shall see anon. : None
ANTENOR passes : ['None - []'] : PANDARUS
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Who's that? : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you; : None
1.2 :and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundest : None
1.2 :judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person. : None
1.2 :When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if : None
1.2 :he see me, you shall see him nod at me. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Will he give you the nod? : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :You shall see. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :If he do, the rich shall have more. : None
HECTOR passes : ["TO - ['HECTOR']"] : CRESSIDA
PANDARUS
1.2 :That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a : None
1.2 :fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man, : None
1.2 :niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's : None
1.2 :a countenance! is't not a brave man? : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :O, a brave man! : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you : None
1.2 :what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do : None
1.2 :you see? look you there: there's no jesting; : None
1.2 :there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say: : None
1.2 :there be hacks! : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Be those with swords? : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Swords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil come : None
1.2 :to him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one's : None
1.2 :heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris. : None
PARIS passes : ["None - ['PARIS']"] : PANDARUS
1.2 :Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too, : None
1.2 :is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came : None
1.2 :hurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will do : None
1.2 :Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could see : None
1.2 :Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon. : None
HELENUS passes : ["None - ['HELENUS']"] : PANDARUS
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Who's that? : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's : None
1.2 :Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Can Helenus fight, uncle? : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I : None
1.2 :marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the : None
1.2 :people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :What sneaking fellow comes yonder? : None
TROILUS passes : ["None - ['TROILUS']"] : CRESSIDA
PANDARUS
1.2 :Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus! : None
1.2 :there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the : None
1.2 :prince of chivalry! : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Peace, for shame, peace! : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon : None
1.2 :him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and : None
1.2 :his helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks, : None
1.2 :and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw : None
1.2 :three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way! : None
1.2 :Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess, : None
1.2 :he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris? : None
1.2 :Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to : None
1.2 :change, would give an eye to boot. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Here come more. : None
Forces pass : ['None - []'] : CRESSIDA
PANDARUS
1.2 :Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran! : None
1.2 :porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the : None
1.2 :eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles : None
1.2 :are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had : None
1.2 :rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and : None
1.2 :all Greece. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus. : None
PANDARUS
1.2 :Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel. : None
CRESSIDA
1.2 :Well, well. : None
PANDARUS
