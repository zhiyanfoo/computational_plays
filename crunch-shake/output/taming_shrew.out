GRUMIO

1.2 :Unless you will accompany me thither. : None
GRUMIO
1.2 :I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. : None
1.2 :O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she : None
1.2 :would think scolding would do little good upon him: : None
1.2 :she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so: : None
1.2 :why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in : None
1.2 :his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she : None
1.2 :stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in : None
1.2 :her face and so disfigure her with it that she : None

1.2 :You know him not, sir. : None
HORTENSIO

1.2 :His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca, : None
1.2 :And her withholds from me and other more, : None
1.2 :Suitors to her and rivals in my love, : None
1.2 :Supposing it a thing impossible, : None
1.2 :For those defects I have before rehearsed, : None
1.2 :That ever Katharina will be woo'd; : None
1.2 :Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en, : None
1.2 :That none shall have access unto Bianca : None

1.2 :And offer me disguised in sober robes : None
1.2 :To old Baptista as a schoolmaster : None
1.2 :Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca; : None
1.2 :That so I may, by this device, at least : None
1.2 :Have leave and leisure to make love to her : None
