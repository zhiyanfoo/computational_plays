Enter ORLANDO and ADAM : ["Enter - ['ORLANDO', 'ADAM']"] : None
ORLANDO
1.1 :As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion : None
1.1 :bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns, : None
1.1 :and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his : None
1.1 :blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my : None
1.1 :sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and : None
1.1 :report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part, : None
1.1 :he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more : None
1.1 :properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you : None
1.1 :that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that : None
1.1 :differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses : None
1.1 :are bred better; for, besides that they are fair : None
1.1 :with their feeding, they are taught their manage, : None
1.1 :and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his : None
1.1 :brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the : None
1.1 :which his animals on his dunghills are as much : None
1.1 :bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so : None
1.1 :plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave : None
1.1 :me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets : None
1.1 :me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a : None
1.1 :brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my : None
1.1 :gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that : None
1.1 :grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I : None
1.1 :think is within me, begins to mutiny against this : None
1.1 :servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I : None
1.1 :know no wise remedy how to avoid it. : None
ADAM
1.1 :Yonder comes my master, your brother. : None
ORLANDO
1.1 :Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will : None
1.1 :shake me up. : None
Enter OLIVER : ["Enter - ['OLIVER']"] : ORLANDO
OLIVER
1.1 :Now, sir! what make you here? : None
ORLANDO
1.1 :Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing. : None
OLIVER
1.1 :What mar you then, sir? : None
ORLANDO
1.1 :Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God : None
1.1 :made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness. : None
OLIVER
1.1 :Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile. : None
ORLANDO
1.1 :Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them? : None
1.1 :What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should : None
1.1 :come to such penury? : None
OLIVER
1.1 :Know you where your are, sir? : None
ORLANDO
1.1 :O, sir, very well; here in your orchard. : None
OLIVER
1.1 :Know you before whom, sir? : None
ORLANDO
1.1 :Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know : None
1.1 :you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle : None
1.1 :condition of blood, you should so know me. The : None
1.1 :courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that : None
1.1 :you are the first-born; but the same tradition : None
1.1 :takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers : None
1.1 :betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as : None
1.1 :you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is : None
1.1 :nearer to his reverence. : None
OLIVER
1.1 :What, boy! : None
ORLANDO
1.1 :Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this. : None
OLIVER
1.1 :Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain? : None
ORLANDO
1.1 :I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir : None
1.1 :Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice : None
1.1 :a villain that says such a father begot villains. : None
1.1 :Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand : None
1.1 :from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy : None
1.1 :tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself. : None
ADAM
1.1 :Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's : None
1.1 :remembrance, be at accord. : None
OLIVER
1.1 :Let me go, I say. : None
ORLANDO
1.1 :I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My : None
1.1 :father charged you in his will to give me good : None
1.1 :education: you have trained me like a peasant, : None
1.1 :obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like : None
1.1 :qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in : None
1.1 :me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow : None
1.1 :me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or : None
1.1 :give me the poor allottery my father left me by : None
1.1 :testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes. : None
OLIVER
1.1 :And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent? : None
1.1 :Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled : None
1.1 :with you; you shall have some part of your will: I : None
1.1 :pray you, leave me. : None
ORLANDO
1.1 :I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good. : None
OLIVER
1.1 :Get you with him, you old dog. : None
ADAM
1.1 :Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my : None
1.1 :teeth in your service. God be with my old master! : None
1.1 :he would not have spoke such a word. : None
Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM : ["Exeunt - ['ORLANDO', 'ADAM']"] : ADAM
OLIVER
1.1 :Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will : None
1.1 :physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand : None
1.1 :crowns neither. Holla, Dennis! : None
Enter DENNIS : ["Enter - ['DENNIS']"] : OLIVER
DENNIS
1.1 :Calls your worship? : None
OLIVER
1.1 :Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me? : None
DENNIS
1.1 :So please you, he is here at the door and importunes : None
1.1 :access to you. : None
OLIVER
1.1 :Call him in. : None
Exit DENNIS : ["Exit - ['DENNIS']"] : OLIVER
1.1 :'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is. : None
Enter CHARLES : ["Enter - ['CHARLES']"] : OLIVER
CHARLES
1.1 :Good morrow to your worship. : None
OLIVER
1.1 :Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the : None
1.1 :new court? : None
CHARLES
1.1 :There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news: : None
1.1 :that is, the old duke is banished by his younger : None
1.1 :brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords : None
1.1 :have put themselves into voluntary exile with him, : None
1.1 :whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke; : None
1.1 :therefore he gives them good leave to wander. : None
OLIVER
1.1 :Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be : None
1.1 :banished with her father? : None
CHARLES
1.1 :O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves : None
1.1 :her, being ever from their cradles bred together, : None
1.1 :that she would have followed her exile, or have died : None
1.1 :to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no : None
1.1 :less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and : None
1.1 :never two ladies loved as they do. : None
OLIVER
1.1 :Where will the old duke live? : None
CHARLES
1.1 :They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and : None
1.1 :a many merry men with him; and there they live like : None
1.1 :the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young : None
1.1 :gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time : None
1.1 :carelessly, as they did in the golden world. : None
OLIVER
1.1 :What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke? : None
CHARLES
1.1 :Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a : None
1.1 :matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand : None
1.1 :that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition : None
1.1 :to come in disguised against me to try a fall. : None
1.1 :To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that : None
1.1 :escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him : None
1.1 :well. Your brother is but young and tender; and, : None
1.1 :for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I : None
1.1 :must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore, : None
1.1 :out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you : None
1.1 :withal, that either you might stay him from his : None
1.1 :intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall : None
1.1 :run into, in that it is a thing of his own search : None
1.1 :and altogether against my will. : None
OLIVER
1.1 :Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which : None
1.1 :thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had : None
1.1 :myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and : None
1.1 :have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from : None
1.1 :it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles: : None
1.1 :it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full : None
1.1 :of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's : None
1.1 :good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against : None
1.1 :me his natural brother: therefore use thy : None
1.1 :discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck : None
1.1 :as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if : None
1.1 :thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not : None
1.1 :mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise : None
1.1 :against thee by poison, entrap thee by some : None
1.1 :treacherous device and never leave thee till he : None
1.1 :hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other; : None
1.1 :for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak : None
1.1 :it, there is not one so young and so villanous this : None
1.1 :day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but : None
1.1 :should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must : None
1.1 :blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder. : None
CHARLES
1.1 :I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come : None
1.1 :to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go : None
1.1 :alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and : None
1.1 :so God keep your worship! : None
OLIVER
1.1 :Farewell, good Charles. : None
Exit CHARLES : ["Exit - ['CHARLES']"] : OLIVER
1.1 :Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see : None
1.1 :an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why, : None
1.1 :hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never : None
1.1 :schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of : None
1.1 :all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much : None
1.1 :in the heart of the world, and especially of my own : None
1.1 :people, who best know him, that I am altogether : None
1.1 :misprised: but it shall not be so long; this : None
1.1 :wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that : None
1.1 :I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about. : None

CELIA
1.2 :I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry. : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of; : None
1.2 :and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could : None
1.2 :teach me to forget a banished father, you must not : None
1.2 :learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure. : None
CELIA
1.2 :Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight : None
1.2 :that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father, : None
1.2 :had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou : None
1.2 :hadst been still with me, I could have taught my : None
1.2 :love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou, : None
1.2 :if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously : None
1.2 :tempered as mine is to thee. : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to : None
1.2 :rejoice in yours. : None
CELIA
1.2 :You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is : None
1.2 :like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt : None
1.2 :be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy : None
1.2 :father perforce, I will render thee again in : None
1.2 :affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break : None
1.2 :that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my : None
1.2 :sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry. : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let : None
1.2 :me see; what think you of falling in love? : None
CELIA
1.2 :Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but : None
1.2 :love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport : None
1.2 :neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst : None
1.2 :in honour come off again. : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :What shall be our sport, then? : None
CELIA
1.2 :Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from : None
1.2 :her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally. : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :I would we could do so, for her benefits are : None
1.2 :mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman : None
1.2 :doth most mistake in her gifts to women. : None
CELIA
1.2 :'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce : None
1.2 :makes honest, and those that she makes honest she : None
1.2 :makes very ill-favouredly. : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to : None
1.2 :Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world, : None
1.2 :not in the lineaments of Nature. : None
Enter TOUCHSTONE : ["Enter - ['TOUCHSTONE']"] : ROSALIND
CELIA
1.2 :No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she : None
1.2 :not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature : None
1.2 :hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not : None
1.2 :Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument? : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when : None
1.2 :Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of : None
1.2 :Nature's wit. : None
CELIA
1.2 :Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but : None
1.2 :Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull : None
1.2 :to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this : None
1.2 :natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of : None
1.2 :the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now, : None
1.2 :wit! whither wander you? : None
TOUCHSTONE
1.2 :Mistress, you must come away to your father. : None
CELIA
1.2 :Were you made the messenger? : None
TOUCHSTONE
1.2 :No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you. : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :Where learned you that oath, fool? : None
TOUCHSTONE
1.2 :Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they : None
1.2 :were good pancakes and swore by his honour the : None
1.2 :mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the : None
1.2 :pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and : None
1.2 :yet was not the knight forsworn. : None
CELIA
1.2 :How prove you that, in the great heap of your : None
1.2 :knowledge? : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom. : None
TOUCHSTONE
1.2 :Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and : None
1.2 :swear by your beards that I am a knave. : None
CELIA
1.2 :By our beards, if we had them, thou art. : None
TOUCHSTONE
1.2 :By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you : None
1.2 :swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no : None
1.2 :more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he : None
1.2 :never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away : None
1.2 :before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard. : None
CELIA
1.2 :Prithee, who is't that thou meanest? : None
TOUCHSTONE
1.2 :One that old Frederick, your father, loves. : None
CELIA
1.2 :My father's love is enough to honour him: enough! : None
1.2 :speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation : None
1.2 :one of these days. : None
TOUCHSTONE
1.2 :The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what : None
1.2 :wise men do foolishly. : None
CELIA
1.2 :By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little : None
1.2 :wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery : None
1.2 :that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes : None
1.2 :Monsieur Le Beau. : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :With his mouth full of news. : None
CELIA
1.2 :Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young. : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :Then shall we be news-crammed. : None
CELIA
1.2 :All the better; we shall be the more marketable. : None
Enter LE BEAU : ["Enter - ['LE BEAU']"] : CELIA
1.2 :Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news? : None
LE BEAU
1.2 :Fair princess, you have lost much good sport. : None
CELIA
1.2 :Sport! of what colour? : None
LE BEAU
1.2 :What colour, madam! how shall I answer you? : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :As wit and fortune will. : None
TOUCHSTONE
1.2 :Or as the Destinies decree. : None
CELIA
1.2 :Well said: that was laid on with a trowel. : None
TOUCHSTONE
1.2 :Nay, if I keep not my rank,-- : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :Thou losest thy old smell. : None
LE BEAU
1.2 :You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good : None
1.2 :wrestling, which you have lost the sight of. : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :You tell us the manner of the wrestling. : None
LE BEAU
1.2 :I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please : None
1.2 :your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is : None
1.2 :yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming : None
1.2 :to perform it. : None
CELIA
1.2 :Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried. : None
LE BEAU
1.2 :There comes an old man and his three sons,-- : None
CELIA
1.2 :I could match this beginning with an old tale. : None
LE BEAU
1.2 :Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence. : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men : None
1.2 :by these presents.' : None
LE BEAU
1.2 :The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the : None
1.2 :duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him : None
1.2 :and broke three of his ribs, that there is little : None
1.2 :hope of life in him: so he served the second, and : None
1.2 :so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man, : None
1.2 :their father, making such pitiful dole over them : None
1.2 :that all the beholders take his part with weeping. : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :Alas! : None
TOUCHSTONE
1.2 :But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies : None
1.2 :have lost? : None
LE BEAU
1.2 :Why, this that I speak of. : None
TOUCHSTONE
1.2 :Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first : None
1.2 :time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport : None
1.2 :for ladies. : None
CELIA
1.2 :Or I, I promise thee. : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :But is there any else longs to see this broken music : None
1.2 :in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon : None
1.2 :rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin? : None
LE BEAU
1.2 :You must, if you stay here; for here is the place : None
1.2 :appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to : None
1.2 :perform it. : None
CELIA
1.2 :Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it. : None

ROSALIND
1.2 :Is yonder the man? : None
LE BEAU
1.2 :Even he, madam. : None
CELIA
1.2 :Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully. : None
DUKE FREDERICK
1.2 :How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither : None
1.2 :to see the wrestling? : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave. : None
DUKE FREDERICK
1.2 :You will take little delight in it, I can tell you; : None
1.2 :there is such odds in the man. In pity of the : None
1.2 :challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he : None
1.2 :will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if : None
1.2 :you can move him. : None
CELIA
1.2 :Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau. : None
DUKE FREDERICK
1.2 :Do so: I'll not be by. : None
LE BEAU

ORLANDO
1.2 :I attend them with all respect and duty. : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler? : None
ORLANDO
1.2 :No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I : None
1.2 :come but in, as others do, to try with him the : None
1.2 :strength of my youth. : None
CELIA
1.2 :Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your : None
1.2 :years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's : None
1.2 :strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or : None
1.2 :knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your : None
1.2 :adventure would counsel you to a more equal : None
1.2 :enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to : None
1.2 :embrace your own safety and give over this attempt. : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore : None
1.2 :be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke : None
1.2 :that the wrestling might not go forward. : None
ORLANDO
1.2 :I beseech you, punish me not with your hard : None
1.2 :thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny : None
1.2 :so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let : None
1.2 :your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my : None
1.2 :trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one : None
1.2 :shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one : None
1.2 :dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my : None
1.2 :friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the : None
1.2 :world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in : None
1.2 :the world I fill up a place, which may be better : None
1.2 :supplied when I have made it empty. : None
ROSALIND
1.2 :The little strength that I have, I would it were with you. : None
CELIA

CHARLES
1.2 :Come, where is this young gallant that is so : None

DUKE FREDERICK
1.2 :You shall try but one fall. : None
CHARLES
1.2 :No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him : None
1.2 :to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him : None
1.2 :from a first. : None
ORLANDO
1.2 :An you mean to mock me after, you should not have : None

ORLANDO
1.2 :Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys. : None
DUKE FREDERICK
1.2 :I would thou hadst been son to some man else: : None
1.2 :The world esteem'd thy father honourable, : None
1.2 :But I did find him still mine enemy: : None
1.2 :Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed, : None

CORIN
3.2 :And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone? : None
TOUCHSTONE
3.2 :Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good : None
3.2 :life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life, : None
3.2 :it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I : None
3.2 :like it very well; but in respect that it is : None
3.2 :private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it : None
3.2 :is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in : None
3.2 :respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As : None
3.2 :is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well; : None
3.2 :but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much : None
3.2 :against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd? : None
CORIN
3.2 :No more but that I know the more one sickens the : None
3.2 :worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money, : None
3.2 :means and content is without three good friends; : None
3.2 :that the property of rain is to wet and fire to : None
3.2 :burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a : None
3.2 :great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that : None
3.2 :he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may : None
3.2 :complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred. : None
TOUCHSTONE
3.2 :Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in : None
3.2 :court, shepherd? : None
CORIN
3.2 :No, truly. : None
TOUCHSTONE
3.2 :Then thou art damned. : None
CORIN
3.2 :Nay, I hope. : None
TOUCHSTONE
3.2 :Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all : None
3.2 :on one side. : None
CORIN
3.2 :For not being at court? Your reason. : None
TOUCHSTONE
3.2 :Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest : None
3.2 :good manners; if thou never sawest good manners, : None
3.2 :then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is : None
3.2 :sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous : None
3.2 :state, shepherd. : None
CORIN
3.2 :Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners : None
3.2 :at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the : None
3.2 :behavior of the country is most mockable at the : None
3.2 :court. You told me you salute not at the court, but : None
3.2 :you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be : None
3.2 :uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds. : None
TOUCHSTONE
3.2 :Instance, briefly; come, instance. : None
CORIN
3.2 :Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their : None

TOUCHSTONE
3.2 :Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not : None
3.2 :the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of : None
3.2 :a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come. : None
CORIN
3.2 :Besides, our hands are hard. : None
TOUCHSTONE
3.2 :Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again. : None
3.2 :A more sounder instance, come. : None
CORIN
3.2 :And they are often tarred over with the surgery of : None
3.2 :our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The : None
3.2 :courtier's hands are perfumed with civet. : None
TOUCHSTONE
3.2 :Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a : None
3.2 :good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and : None
3.2 :perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the : None
3.2 :very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd. : None
CORIN
3.2 :You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest. : None
TOUCHSTONE
3.2 :Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man! : None
3.2 :God make incision in thee! thou art raw. : None
CORIN
3.2 :Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get : None
3.2 :that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's : None
3.2 :happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my : None
3.2 :harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes : None
3.2 :graze and my lambs suck. : None
TOUCHSTONE
3.2 :That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes : None
3.2 :and the rams together and to offer to get your : None
3.2 :living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a : None
3.2 :bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a : None
3.2 :twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram, : None
3.2 :out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not : None

ROSALIND
3.2 :O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of : None

CELIA
3.2 :That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses. : None

ORLANDO
3.2 :Who ambles Time withal? : None
ROSALIND
3.2 :With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that : None
3.2 :hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because : None
3.2 :he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because : None
3.2 :he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean : None
3.2 :and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden : None
3.2 :of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal. : None
ORLANDO
3.2 :Who doth he gallop withal? : None
ROSALIND
3.2 :With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as : None
3.2 :softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there. : None
ORLANDO
3.2 :Who stays it still withal? : None
ROSALIND
3.2 :With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between : None

ORLANDO
3.2 :Where dwell you, pretty youth? : None
ROSALIND
3.2 :With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the : None

ORLANDO
3.2 :Are you native of this place? : None
ROSALIND
3.2 :As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled. : None
ORLANDO
3.2 :Your accent is something finer than you could : None
3.2 :purchase in so removed a dwelling. : None
ROSALIND
3.2 :I have been told so of many: but indeed an old : None
3.2 :religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was : None
3.2 :in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship : None
3.2 :too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard : None
3.2 :him read many lectures against it, and I thank God : None
3.2 :I am not a woman, to be touched with so many : None
3.2 :giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their : None
3.2 :whole sex withal. : None
ORLANDO
3.2 :Can you remember any of the principal evils that he : None
3.2 :laid to the charge of women? : None
ROSALIND
3.2 :There were none principal; they were all like one : None
3.2 :another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming : None
3.2 :monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it. : None
ORLANDO
3.2 :I prithee, recount some of them. : None
ROSALIND
3.2 :No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that : None
3.2 :are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that : None
3.2 :abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on : None
3.2 :their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies : None
3.2 :on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of : None
3.2 :Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would : None
3.2 :give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the : None
3.2 :quotidian of love upon him. : None
ORLANDO
3.2 :I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me : None
3.2 :your remedy. : None
ROSALIND
3.2 :There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he : None
3.2 :taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage : None
3.2 :of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner. : None
ORLANDO
3.2 :What were his marks? : None
ROSALIND
3.2 :A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and : None
3.2 :sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable : None
3.2 :spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected, : None
3.2 :which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for : None
3.2 :simply your having in beard is a younger brother's : None
3.2 :revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your : None
3.2 :bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe : None
3.2 :untied and every thing about you demonstrating a : None
3.2 :careless desolation; but you are no such man; you : None
3.2 :are rather point-device in your accoutrements as : None
3.2 :loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other. : None
ORLANDO
3.2 :Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love. : None
ROSALIND
3.2 :Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you : None
3.2 :love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to : None
3.2 :do than to confess she does: that is one of the : None
3.2 :points in the which women still give the lie to : None
3.2 :their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he : None
3.2 :that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind : None
3.2 :is so admired? : None
ORLANDO
3.2 :I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of : None
3.2 :Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he. : None
ROSALIND
3.2 :But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak? : None
ORLANDO
3.2 :Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much. : None
ROSALIND
3.2 :Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves : None
3.2 :as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and : None
3.2 :the reason why they are not so punished and cured : None
3.2 :is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers : None
3.2 :are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel. : None
ORLANDO
3.2 :Did you ever cure any so? : None
ROSALIND
3.2 :Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me : None
3.2 :his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to : None
3.2 :woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish : None
3.2 :youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing : None
3.2 :and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, : None
3.2 :inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every : None
3.2 :passion something and for no passion truly any : None
3.2 :thing, as boys and women are for the most part : None
3.2 :cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe : None
3.2 :him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep : None
3.2 :for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor : None
3.2 :from his mad humour of love to a living humour of : None
3.2 :madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of : None

4.1 :Rosalind of a better leer than you. : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday : None
4.1 :humour and like enough to consent. What would you : None
4.1 :say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind? : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :I would kiss before I spoke. : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were : None
4.1 :gravelled for lack of matter, you might take : None
4.1 :occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are : None
4.1 :out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God : None
4.1 :warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss. : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :How if the kiss be denied? : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter. : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress? : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or : None
4.1 :I should think my honesty ranker than my wit. : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :What, of my suit? : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit. : None
4.1 :Am not I your Rosalind? : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :I take some joy to say you are, because I would be : None
4.1 :talking of her. : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :Well in her person I say I will not have you. : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :Then in mine own person I die. : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is : None
4.1 :almost six thousand years old, and in all this time : None
4.1 :there was not any man died in his own person, : None
4.1 :videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains : None
4.1 :dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he : None
4.1 :could to die before, and he is one of the patterns : None
4.1 :of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair : None
4.1 :year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been : None
4.1 :for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went : None
4.1 :but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being : None
4.1 :taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish : None
4.1 :coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.' : None
4.1 :But these are all lies: men have died from time to : None
4.1 :time and worms have eaten them, but not for love. : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind, : None
4.1 :for, I protest, her frown might kill me. : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now : None
4.1 :I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on : None
4.1 :disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant : None
4.1 :it. : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :Then love me, Rosalind. : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all. : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :And wilt thou have me? : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :Ay, and twenty such. : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :What sayest thou? : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :Are you not good? : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :I hope so. : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing? : None
4.1 :Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us. : None
4.1 :Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister? : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :Pray thee, marry us. : None
CELIA
4.1 :I cannot say the words. : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--' : None
CELIA
4.1 :Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind? : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :I will. : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :Ay, but when? : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :Why now; as fast as she can marry us. : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.' : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :I take thee, Rosalind, for wife. : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :I might ask you for your commission; but I do take : None
4.1 :thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes : None
4.1 :before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought : None
4.1 :runs before her actions. : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :So do all thoughts; they are winged. : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :Now tell me how long you would have her after you : None
4.1 :have possessed her. : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :For ever and a day. : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando; : None
4.1 :men are April when they woo, December when they wed: : None
4.1 :maids are May when they are maids, but the sky : None
4.1 :changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous : None
4.1 :of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen, : None
4.1 :more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more : None
4.1 :new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires : None
4.1 :than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana : None
4.1 :in the fountain, and I will do that when you are : None
4.1 :disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and : None
4.1 :that when thou art inclined to sleep. : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :But will my Rosalind do so? : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :By my life, she will do as I do. : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :O, but she is wise. : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the : None
4.1 :wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's : None
4.1 :wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and : None
4.1 :'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly : None
4.1 :with the smoke out at the chimney. : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say : None
4.1 :'Wit, whither wilt?' : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met : None
4.1 :your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed. : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :And what wit could wit have to excuse that? : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall : None
4.1 :never take her without her answer, unless you take : None
4.1 :her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot : None
4.1 :make her fault her husband's occasion, let her : None

ORLANDO

ROSALIND
4.1 :Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you : None
4.1 :would prove: my friends told me as much, and I : None
4.1 :thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours : None
4.1 :won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come, : None
4.1 :death! Two o'clock is your hour? : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :Ay, sweet Rosalind. : None
ROSALIND
4.1 :By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend : None
4.1 :me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous, : None
4.1 :if you break one jot of your promise or come one : None
4.1 :minute behind your hour, I will think you the most : None
4.1 :pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover : None
4.1 :and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that : None
4.1 :may be chosen out of the gross band of the : None
4.1 :unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep : None
4.1 :your promise. : None
ORLANDO
4.1 :With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my : None
