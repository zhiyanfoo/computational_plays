Enter RODERIGO and IAGO : ["Enter - ['RODERIGO', 'IAGO']"] : None
RODERIGO
1.1 :Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly : None
1.1 :That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse : None
1.1 :As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this. : None
IAGO
1.1 :'Sblood, but you will not hear me: : None
1.1 :If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me. : None
RODERIGO
1.1 :Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate. : None
IAGO
1.1 :Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city, : None
1.1 :In personal suit to make me his lieutenant, : None
1.1 :Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man, : None
1.1 :I know my price, I am worth no worse a place: : None
1.1 :But he; as loving his own pride and purposes, : None
1.1 :Evades them, with a bombast circumstance : None
1.1 :Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war; : None
1.1 :And, in conclusion, : None
1.1 :Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he, : None
1.1 :'I have already chose my officer.' : None
1.1 :And what was he? : None
1.1 :Forsooth, a great arithmetician, : None
1.1 :One Michael Cassio, a Florentine, : None
1.1 :A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife; : None
1.1 :That never set a squadron in the field, : None
1.1 :Nor the division of a battle knows : None
1.1 :More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric, : None
1.1 :Wherein the toged consuls can propose : None
1.1 :As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise, : None
1.1 :Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election: : None
1.1 :And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof : None
1.1 :At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds : None
1.1 :Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd : None
1.1 :By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster, : None
1.1 :He, in good time, must his lieutenant be, : None
1.1 :And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient. : None
RODERIGO
1.1 :By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman. : None
IAGO
1.1 :Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service, : None
1.1 :Preferment goes by letter and affection, : None
1.1 :And not by old gradation, where each second : None
1.1 :Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself, : None
1.1 :Whether I in any just term am affined : None
1.1 :To love the Moor. : None
RODERIGO
1.1 :I would not follow him then. : None
IAGO
1.1 :O, sir, content you; : None
1.1 :I follow him to serve my turn upon him: : None
1.1 :We cannot all be masters, nor all masters : None
1.1 :Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark : None
1.1 :Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave, : None
1.1 :That, doting on his own obsequious bondage, : None
1.1 :Wears out his time, much like his master's ass, : None
1.1 :For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd: : None
1.1 :Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are : None
1.1 :Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty, : None
1.1 :Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves, : None
1.1 :And, throwing but shows of service on their lords, : None
1.1 :Do well thrive by them and when they have lined : None
1.1 :their coats : None
1.1 :Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul; : None
1.1 :And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir, : None
1.1 :It is as sure as you are Roderigo, : None
1.1 :Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago: : None
1.1 :In following him, I follow but myself; : None
1.1 :Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty, : None
1.1 :But seeming so, for my peculiar end: : None
1.1 :For when my outward action doth demonstrate : None
1.1 :The native act and figure of my heart : None
1.1 :In compliment extern, 'tis not long after : None
1.1 :But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve : None
1.1 :For daws to peck at: I am not what I am. : None
RODERIGO
1.1 :What a full fortune does the thicklips owe : None
1.1 :If he can carry't thus! : None
IAGO
1.1 :Call up her father, : None
1.1 :Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight, : None
1.1 :Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen, : None
1.1 :And, though he in a fertile climate dwell, : None
1.1 :Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy, : None
1.1 :Yet throw such changes of vexation on't, : None
1.1 :As it may lose some colour. : None
RODERIGO
1.1 :Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud. : None
IAGO
1.1 :Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell : None
1.1 :As when, by night and negligence, the fire : None
1.1 :Is spied in populous cities. : None
RODERIGO
1.1 :What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho! : None
IAGO
1.1 :Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves! : None
1.1 :Look to your house, your daughter and your bags! : None
1.1 :Thieves! thieves! : None
BRABANTIO appears above, at a window : ["None - ['BRABANTIO']"] : IAGO
BRABANTIO
1.1 :What is the reason of this terrible summons? : None
1.1 :What is the matter there? : None
RODERIGO
1.1 :Signior, is all your family within? : None
IAGO
1.1 :Are your doors lock'd? : None
BRABANTIO
1.1 :Why, wherefore ask you this? : None
IAGO
1.1 :'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on : None
1.1 :your gown; : None
1.1 :Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul; : None
1.1 :Even now, now, very now, an old black ram : None
1.1 :Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise; : None
1.1 :Awake the snorting citizens with the bell, : None
1.1 :Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you: : None
1.1 :Arise, I say. : None
BRABANTIO
1.1 :                  What, have you lost your wits? : None
RODERIGO

RODERIGO
1.1 :My name is Roderigo. : None
BRABANTIO
1.1 :The worser welcome: : None
1.1 :I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors: : None
1.1 :In honest plainness thou hast heard me say : None
1.1 :My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness, : None
1.1 :Being full of supper and distempering draughts, : None
1.1 :Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come : None
1.1 :To start my quiet. : None
RODERIGO
1.1 :Sir, sir, sir,-- : None
BRABANTIO
1.1 :                  But thou must needs be sure : None
1.1 :My spirit and my place have in them power : None
1.1 :To make this bitter to thee. : None
RODERIGO
1.1 :Patience, good sir. : None
BRABANTIO
1.1 :What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice; : None
1.1 :My house is not a grange. : None
RODERIGO
1.1 :Most grave Brabantio, : None
1.1 :In simple and pure soul I come to you. : None
IAGO
1.1 :'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not : None
1.1 :serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to : None
1.1 :do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll : None
1.1 :have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse; : None
1.1 :you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have : None
1.1 :coursers for cousins and gennets for germans. : None
BRABANTIO
1.1 :What profane wretch art thou? : None
IAGO
1.1 :I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter : None
1.1 :and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs. : None
BRABANTIO
1.1 :Thou art a villain. : None
IAGO
1.1 :You are--a senator. : None
BRABANTIO
1.1 :This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo. : None
RODERIGO
1.1 :Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you, : None
1.1 :If't be your pleasure and most wise consent, : None
1.1 :As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter, : None
1.1 :At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night, : None
1.1 :Transported, with no worse nor better guard : None
1.1 :But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier, : None
1.1 :To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor-- : None
1.1 :If this be known to you and your allowance, : None
1.1 :We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs; : None
1.1 :But if you know not this, my manners tell me : None
1.1 :We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe : None
1.1 :That, from the sense of all civility, : None
1.1 :I thus would play and trifle with your reverence: : None
1.1 :Your daughter, if you have not given her leave, : None
1.1 :I say again, hath made a gross revolt; : None
1.1 :Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes : None
1.1 :In an extravagant and wheeling stranger : None
1.1 :Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself: : None
1.1 :If she be in her chamber or your house, : None
1.1 :Let loose on me the justice of the state : None
1.1 :For thus deluding you. : None
BRABANTIO
1.1 :Strike on the tinder, ho! : None
1.1 :Give me a taper! call up all my people! : None
1.1 :This accident is not unlike my dream: : None
1.1 :Belief of it oppresses me already. : None
1.1 :Light, I say! light! : None
Exit above : ['Exit - []'] : BRABANTIO
IAGO
1.1 :Farewell; for I must leave you: : None
1.1 :It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place, : None
1.1 :To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall-- : None
1.1 :Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state, : None
1.1 :However this may gall him with some cheque, : None
1.1 :Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd : None
1.1 :With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars, : None
1.1 :Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls, : None
1.1 :Another of his fathom they have none, : None
1.1 :To lead their business: in which regard, : None
1.1 :Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains. : None
1.1 :Yet, for necessity of present life, : None
1.1 :I must show out a flag and sign of love, : None
1.1 :Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him, : None
1.1 :Lead to the Sagittary the raised search; : None
1.1 :And there will I be with him. So, farewell. : None

BRABANTIO
1.1 :It is too true an evil: gone she is; : None
1.1 :And what's to come of my despised time : None
1.1 :Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo, : None
1.1 :Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl! : None
1.1 :With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father! : None
1.1 :How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me : None
1.1 :Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers: : None
1.1 :Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you? : None

BRABANTIO
1.1 :O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood! : None
1.1 :Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds : None
1.1 :By what you see them act. Is there not charms : None
1.1 :By which the property of youth and maidhood : None
1.1 :May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo, : None
1.1 :Of some such thing? : None
RODERIGO
1.1 :Yes, sir, I have indeed. : None
BRABANTIO
1.1 :Call up my brother. O, would you had had her! : None
1.1 :Some one way, some another. Do you know : None
1.1 :Where we may apprehend her and the Moor? : None
RODERIGO
1.1 :I think I can discover him, if you please, : None

BRABANTIO

BRABANTIO
1.2 :O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter? : None

1.3 :Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense, : None
1.3 :Sans witchcraft could not. : None
DUKE OF VENICE
1.3 :Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding : None
1.3 :Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself : None
1.3 :And you of her, the bloody book of law : None
1.3 :You shall yourself read in the bitter letter : None
1.3 :After your own sense, yea, though our proper son : None
1.3 :Stood in your action. : None
BRABANTIO
1.3 :Humbly I thank your grace. : None
1.3 :Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems, : None
1.3 :Your special mandate for the state-affairs : None
1.3 :Hath hither brought. : None
DUKE OF VENICE
SENATOR
1.3 :We are very sorry for't. : None
DUKE OF VENICE
1.3 :  What, in your own part, can you say to this? : To OTHELLO : ["To - ['OTHELLO']"] : DUKE OF VENICE
BRABANTIO
1.3 :Nothing, but this is so. : None
OTHELLO
1.3 :Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors, : None
1.3 :My very noble and approved good masters, : None
1.3 :That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter, : None
1.3 :It is most true; true, I have married her: : None
1.3 :The very head and front of my offending : None
1.3 :Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech, : None
1.3 :And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace: : None
1.3 :For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith, : None
1.3 :Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used : None
1.3 :Their dearest action in the tented field, : None
1.3 :And little of this great world can I speak, : None
1.3 :More than pertains to feats of broil and battle, : None
1.3 :And therefore little shall I grace my cause : None
1.3 :In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience, : None
1.3 :I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver : None
1.3 :Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms, : None
1.3 :What conjuration and what mighty magic, : None
1.3 :For such proceeding I am charged withal, : None
1.3 :I won his daughter. : None
BRABANTIO
1.3 :A maiden never bold; : None
1.3 :Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion : None
1.3 :Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature, : None
1.3 :Of years, of country, credit, every thing, : None
1.3 :To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on! : None
1.3 :It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect : None
1.3 :That will confess perfection so could err : None
1.3 :Against all rules of nature, and must be driven : None
1.3 :To find out practises of cunning hell, : None
1.3 :Why this should be. I therefore vouch again : None
1.3 :That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood, : None
1.3 :Or with some dram conjured to this effect, : None
1.3 :He wrought upon her. : None
DUKE OF VENICE
1.3 :To vouch this, is no proof, : None
1.3 :Without more wider and more overt test : None
1.3 :Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods : None
1.3 :Of modern seeming do prefer against him. : None
FIRST SENATOR
1.3 :But, Othello, speak: : None
1.3 :Did you by indirect and forced courses : None
1.3 :Subdue and poison this young maid's affections? : None
1.3 :Or came it by request and such fair question : None
1.3 :As soul to soul affordeth? : None
OTHELLO
1.3 :I do beseech you, : None
1.3 :Send for the lady to the Sagittary, : None
1.3 :And let her speak of me before her father: : None
1.3 :If you do find me foul in her report, : None
1.3 :The trust, the office I do hold of you, : None
1.3 :Not only take away, but let your sentence : None
1.3 :Even fall upon my life. : None
DUKE OF VENICE
1.3 :Fetch Desdemona hither. : None

Exeunt IAGO and Attendants : ["Exeunt - ['IAGO']"] : OTHELLO
1.3 :And, till she come, as truly as to heaven : None
1.3 :I do confess the vices of my blood, : None
1.3 :So justly to your grave ears I'll present : None
1.3 :How I did thrive in this fair lady's love, : None
1.3 :And she in mine. : None
DUKE OF VENICE
1.3 :Say it, Othello. : None
OTHELLO
1.3 :Her father loved me; oft invited me; : None
1.3 :Still question'd me the story of my life, : None
1.3 :From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes, : None
1.3 :That I have passed. : None
1.3 :I ran it through, even from my boyish days, : None
1.3 :To the very moment that he bade me tell it; : None
1.3 :Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances, : None
1.3 :Of moving accidents by flood and field : None
1.3 :Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach, : None
1.3 :Of being taken by the insolent foe : None
1.3 :And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence : None
1.3 :And portance in my travels' history: : None
1.3 :Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle, : None
1.3 :Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven : None
1.3 :It was my hint to speak,--such was the process; : None
1.3 :And of the Cannibals that each other eat, : None
1.3 :The Anthropophagi and men whose heads : None
1.3 :Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear : None
1.3 :Would Desdemona seriously incline: : None
1.3 :But still the house-affairs would draw her thence: : None
1.3 :Which ever as she could with haste dispatch, : None
1.3 :She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear : None
1.3 :Devour up my discourse: which I observing, : None
1.3 :Took once a pliant hour, and found good means : None
1.3 :To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart : None
1.3 :That I would all my pilgrimage dilate, : None
1.3 :Whereof by parcels she had something heard, : None
1.3 :But not intentively: I did consent, : None
1.3 :And often did beguile her of her tears, : None
1.3 :When I did speak of some distressful stroke : None
1.3 :That my youth suffer'd. My story being done, : None
1.3 :She gave me for my pains a world of sighs: : None
1.3 :She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange, : None
1.3 :'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful: : None
1.3 :She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd : None
1.3 :That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me, : None
1.3 :And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her, : None
1.3 :I should but teach him how to tell my story. : None
1.3 :And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake: : None
1.3 :She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd, : None
1.3 :And I loved her that she did pity them. : None
1.3 :This only is the witchcraft I have used: : None
1.3 :Here comes the lady; let her witness it. : None

1.3 :Good Brabantio, : None
1.3 :Take up this mangled matter at the best: : None
1.3 :Men do their broken weapons rather use : None
1.3 :Than their bare hands. : None
BRABANTIO
1.3 :I pray you, hear her speak: : None
1.3 :If she confess that she was half the wooer, : None
1.3 :Destruction on my head, if my bad blame : None
1.3 :Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress: : None
1.3 :Do you perceive in all this noble company : None
1.3 :Where most you owe obedience? : None
DESDEMONA
1.3 :My noble father, : None
1.3 :I do perceive here a divided duty: : None
1.3 :To you I am bound for life and education; : None
1.3 :My life and education both do learn me : None
1.3 :How to respect you; you are the lord of duty; : None
1.3 :I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband, : None
1.3 :And so much duty as my mother show'd : None
1.3 :To you, preferring you before her father, : None
1.3 :So much I challenge that I may profess : None
1.3 :Due to the Moor my lord. : None
BRABANTIO
1.3 :God be wi' you! I have done. : None
1.3 :Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs: : None
1.3 :I had rather to adopt a child than get it. : None
1.3 :Come hither, Moor: : None
1.3 :I here do give thee that with all my heart : None
1.3 :Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart : None
1.3 :I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel, : None
1.3 :I am glad at soul I have no other child: : None
1.3 :For thy escape would teach me tyranny, : None
1.3 :To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord. : None
DUKE OF VENICE
1.3 :Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence, : None
1.3 :Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers : None
1.3 :Into your favour. : None
1.3 :When remedies are past, the griefs are ended : None
1.3 :By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended. : None
1.3 :To mourn a mischief that is past and gone : None
1.3 :Is the next way to draw new mischief on. : None
1.3 :What cannot be preserved when fortune takes : None
1.3 :Patience her injury a mockery makes. : None
1.3 :The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief; : None
1.3 :He robs himself that spends a bootless grief. : None
BRABANTIO
1.3 :So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile; : None
1.3 :We lose it not, so long as we can smile. : None
1.3 :He bears the sentence well that nothing bears : None
1.3 :But the free comfort which from thence he hears, : None
1.3 :But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow : None
1.3 :That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow. : None
1.3 :These sentences, to sugar, or to gall, : None
1.3 :Being strong on both sides, are equivocal: : None
1.3 :But words are words; I never yet did hear : None
1.3 :That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear. : None
1.3 :I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state. : None
DUKE OF VENICE
1.3 :The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for : None
1.3 :Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best : None
1.3 :known to you; and though we have there a substitute : None
1.3 :of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a : None
1.3 :sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer : None
1.3 :voice on you: you must therefore be content to : None
1.3 :slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this : None
1.3 :more stubborn and boisterous expedition. : None
OTHELLO
1.3 :The tyrant custom, most grave senators, : None
1.3 :Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war : None
1.3 :My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise : None
1.3 :A natural and prompt alacrity : None
1.3 :I find in hardness, and do undertake : None
1.3 :These present wars against the Ottomites. : None
1.3 :Most humbly therefore bending to your state, : None
1.3 :I crave fit disposition for my wife. : None
1.3 :Due reference of place and exhibition, : None
1.3 :With such accommodation and besort : None
1.3 :As levels with her breeding. : None
DUKE OF VENICE
1.3 :If you please, : None

BRABANTIO
1.3 :I'll not have it so. : None
OTHELLO
1.3 :Nor I. : None
DESDEMONA
1.3 :     Nor I; I would not there reside, : None

1.3 :To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear; : None
1.3 :And let me find a charter in your voice, : None
1.3 :To assist my simpleness. : None
DUKE OF VENICE
1.3 :What would You, Desdemona? : None
DESDEMONA
1.3 :That I did love the Moor to live with him, : None
1.3 :My downright violence and storm of fortunes : None
1.3 :May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued : None
1.3 :Even to the very quality of my lord: : None
1.3 :I saw Othello's visage in his mind, : None
1.3 :And to his honour and his valiant parts : None
1.3 :Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate. : None
1.3 :So that, dear lords, if I be left behind, : None
1.3 :A moth of peace, and he go to the war, : None
1.3 :The rites for which I love him are bereft me, : None
1.3 :And I a heavy interim shall support : None
1.3 :By his dear absence. Let me go with him. : None
OTHELLO
1.3 :Let her have your voices. : None
1.3 :Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not, : None
1.3 :To please the palate of my appetite, : None
1.3 :Nor to comply with heat--the young affects : None
1.3 :In me defunct--and proper satisfaction. : None
1.3 :But to be free and bounteous to her mind: : None
1.3 :And heaven defend your good souls, that you think : None
1.3 :I will your serious and great business scant : None
1.3 :For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys : None
1.3 :Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness : None
1.3 :My speculative and officed instruments, : None
1.3 :That my disports corrupt and taint my business, : None

DUKE OF VENICE

RODERIGO
1.3 :Iago,-- : None
IAGO
1.3 :What say'st thou, noble heart? : None
RODERIGO
1.3 :What will I do, thinkest thou? : None
IAGO
1.3 :Why, go to bed, and sleep. : None
RODERIGO
1.3 :I will incontinently drown myself. : None
IAGO
1.3 :If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why, : None
1.3 :thou silly gentleman! : None
RODERIGO
1.3 :It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and : None
1.3 :then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician. : None
IAGO
1.3 :O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four : None
1.3 :times seven years; and since I could distinguish : None
1.3 :betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man : None
1.3 :that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I : None
1.3 :would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I : None
1.3 :would change my humanity with a baboon. : None
RODERIGO
1.3 :What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so : None
1.3 :fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it. : None
IAGO
1.3 :Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus : None
1.3 :or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which : None
1.3 :our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant : None
1.3 :nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up : None
1.3 :thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or : None
1.3 :distract it with many, either to have it sterile : None
1.3 :with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the : None
1.3 :power and corrigible authority of this lies in our : None
1.3 :wills. If the balance of our lives had not one : None
1.3 :scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the : None
1.3 :blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us : None
1.3 :to most preposterous conclusions: but we have : None
1.3 :reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal : None
1.3 :stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that : None
1.3 :you call love to be a sect or scion. : None
RODERIGO
1.3 :It cannot be. : None
IAGO
1.3 :It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of : None
1.3 :the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown : None
1.3 :cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy : None
1.3 :friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with : None
1.3 :cables of perdurable toughness; I could never : None
1.3 :better stead thee than now. Put money in thy : None
1.3 :purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with : None
1.3 :an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It : None
1.3 :cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her : None
1.3 :love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he : None
1.3 :his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou : None
1.3 :shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but : None
1.3 :money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in : None
1.3 :their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food : None
1.3 :that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be : None
1.3 :to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must : None
1.3 :change for youth: when she is sated with his body, : None
1.3 :she will find the error of her choice: she must : None
1.3 :have change, she must: therefore put money in thy : None
1.3 :purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a : None
1.3 :more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money : None
1.3 :thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt : None
1.3 :an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not : None
1.3 :too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou : None
1.3 :shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of : None
1.3 :drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek : None
1.3 :thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than : None
1.3 :to be drowned and go without her. : None
RODERIGO
1.3 :Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on : None
1.3 :the issue? : None
IAGO
1.3 :Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told : None
1.3 :thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I : None
1.3 :hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no : None
1.3 :less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge : None
1.3 :against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost : None
1.3 :thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many : None
1.3 :events in the womb of time which will be delivered. : None
1.3 :Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more : None
1.3 :of this to-morrow. Adieu. : None
RODERIGO
1.3 :Where shall we meet i' the morning? : None
IAGO
1.3 :At my lodging. : None
RODERIGO
1.3 :I'll be with thee betimes. : None
IAGO
1.3 :Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo? : None
RODERIGO
1.3 :What say you? : None
IAGO
1.3 :No more of drowning, do you hear? : None
RODERIGO
1.3 :I am changed: I'll go sell all my land. : None
Exit : ['Exit - []'] : RODERIGO

1.3 :Thus do I ever make my fool my purse: : None
1.3 :For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane, : None
1.3 :If I would time expend with such a snipe. : None
1.3 :But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor: : None
1.3 :And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets : None
1.3 :He has done my office: I know not if't be true; : None
1.3 :But I, for mere suspicion in that kind, : None
1.3 :Will do as if for surety. He holds me well; : None
1.3 :The better shall my purpose work on him. : None
1.3 :Cassio's a proper man: let me see now: : None
1.3 :To get his place and to plume up my will : None
1.3 :In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:-- : None
1.3 :After some time, to abuse Othello's ear : None
1.3 :That he is too familiar with his wife. : None
1.3 :He hath a person and a smooth dispose : None
1.3 :To be suspected, framed to make women false. : None
1.3 :The Moor is of a free and open nature, : None
1.3 :That thinks men honest that but seem to be so, : None
1.3 :And will as tenderly be led by the nose : None
1.3 :As asses are. : None
1.3 :I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night : None
1.3 :Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light. : None

MONTANO
2.1 :What from the cape can you discern at sea? : None
FIRST GENTLEMAN
2.1 :Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood; : None
2.1 :I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main, : None
2.1 :Descry a sail. : None
MONTANO
2.1 :Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land; : None
2.1 :A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements: : None
2.1 :If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea, : None
2.1 :What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them, : None
2.1 :Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this? : None
SECOND GENTLEMAN
2.1 :A segregation of the Turkish fleet: : None
2.1 :For do but stand upon the foaming shore, : None
2.1 :The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds; : None
2.1 :The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane, : None
2.1 :seems to cast water on the burning bear, : None
2.1 :And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole: : None
2.1 :I never did like molestation view : None
2.1 :On the enchafed flood. : None
MONTANO
2.1 :If that the Turkish fleet : None
2.1 :Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd: : None
2.1 :It is impossible they bear it out. : None
Enter a third Gentleman : ["Enter - ['THIRD GENTLEMAN']"] : MONTANO
THIRD GENTLEMAN
2.1 :News, lads! our wars are done. : None
2.1 :The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks, : None
2.1 :That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice : None
2.1 :Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance : None
2.1 :On most part of their fleet. : None
MONTANO
2.1 :How! is this true? : None
THIRD GENTLEMAN
2.1 :The ship is here put in, : None

2.1 :Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello, : None
2.1 :Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea, : None
2.1 :And is in full commission here for Cyprus. : None
MONTANO
2.1 :I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor. : None
THIRD GENTLEMAN
2.1 :But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort : None
2.1 :Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly, : None
2.1 :And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted : None
2.1 :With foul and violent tempest. : None
MONTANO
2.1 :Pray heavens he be; : None
2.1 :For I have served him, and the man commands : None
2.1 :Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho! : None
2.1 :As well to see the vessel that's come in : None
2.1 :As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello, : None
2.1 :Even till we make the main and the aerial blue : None
2.1 :An indistinct regard. : None
THIRD GENTLEMAN
2.1 :Come, let's do so: : None
2.1 :For every minute is expectancy : None
2.1 :Of more arrivance. : None

2.1 :lieutenant tonight watches on the court of : None
2.1 :guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is : None

RODERIGO
2.1 :With him! why, 'tis not possible. : None
IAGO
2.1 :Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed. : None
2.1 :Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor, : None
2.1 :but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies: : None
2.1 :and will she love him still for prating? let not : None
2.1 :thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed; : None
2.1 :and what delight shall she have to look on the : None
2.1 :devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of : None
2.1 :sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to : None
2.1 :give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour, : None
2.1 :sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which : None
2.1 :the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these : None
2.1 :required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will : None
2.1 :find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge, : None
2.1 :disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will : None
2.1 :instruct her in it and compel her to some second : None
2.1 :choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most : None
2.1 :pregnant and unforced position--who stands so : None
2.1 :eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio : None
2.1 :does? a knave very voluble; no further : None
2.1 :conscionable than in putting on the mere form of : None
2.1 :civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing : None
2.1 :of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why, : None
2.1 :none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a : None
2.1 :finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and : None
2.1 :counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never : None
2.1 :present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the : None
2.1 :knave is handsome, young, and hath all those : None
2.1 :requisites in him that folly and green minds look : None
2.1 :after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman : None
2.1 :hath found him already. : None
RODERIGO
2.1 :I cannot believe that in her; she's full of : None
2.1 :most blessed condition. : None
IAGO
2.1 :Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of : None
2.1 :grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never : None

2.1 :not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst : None
2.1 :not mark that? : None
RODERIGO
2.1 :Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy. : None
IAGO
2.1 :Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue : None
2.1 :to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met : None
2.1 :so near with their lips that their breaths embraced : None
2.1 :together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these : None
2.1 :mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes : None
2.1 :the master and main exercise, the incorporate : None
2.1 :conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I : None
2.1 :have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night; : None
2.1 :for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows : None
2.1 :you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find : None
2.1 :some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking : None
2.1 :too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what : None
2.1 :other course you please, which the time shall more : None
2.1 :favourably minister. : None
RODERIGO
2.1 :Well. : None
IAGO
2.1 :Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply : None
2.1 :may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for : None
2.1 :even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to : None
2.1 :mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true : None
2.1 :taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So : None
2.1 :shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by : None

2.1 :which there were no expectation of our prosperity. : None

IAGO
2.1 :That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it; : None
2.1 :That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit: : None
2.1 :The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not, : None
2.1 :Is of a constant, loving, noble nature, : None
2.1 :And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona : None
2.1 :A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too; : None
2.1 :Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure : None
2.1 :I stand accountant for as great a sin, : None
2.1 :But partly led to diet my revenge, : None
2.1 :For that I do suspect the lusty Moor : None
2.1 :Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof : None
2.1 :Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards; : None
2.1 :And nothing can or shall content my soul : None
2.1 :Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife, : None
2.1 :Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor : None
2.1 :At least into a jealousy so strong : None
2.1 :That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do, : None
2.1 :If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash : None
2.1 :For his quick hunting, stand the putting on, : None
2.1 :I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip, : None
2.1 :Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb-- : None
2.1 :For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too-- : None
2.1 :Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me. : None
2.1 :For making him egregiously an ass : None
2.1 :And practising upon his peace and quiet : None
2.1 :Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused: : None

2.3 :Iago, my reputation! : None
IAGO
2.3 :As I am an honest man, I thought you had received : None
2.3 :some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than : None

2.3 :imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without : None
2.3 :deserving: you have lost no reputation at all, : None
2.3 :unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man! : None
2.3 :there are ways to recover the general again: you : None

CASSIO
2.3 :I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so : None

IAGO
2.3 :Is't possible? : None
CASSIO
2.3 :I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; : None

2.3 :recovered? : None
CASSIO
2.3 :It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place : None
2.3 :to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me : None
2.3 :another, to make me frankly despise myself. : None
IAGO
2.3 :Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time, : None
2.3 :the place, and the condition of this country : None

2.3 :but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good. : None
CASSIO
2.3 :I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me : None
2.3 :I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, : None
2.3 :such an answer would stop them all. To be now a : None

2.3 :You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man. : None
2.3 :I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife : None

2.3 :so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition, : None
2.3 :she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more : None
2.3 :than she is requested: this broken joint between : None

CASSIO
2.3 :You advise me well. : None
IAGO
2.3 :I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness. : None
CASSIO

2.3 :When this advice is free I give and honest, : None

2.3 :To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy : None
2.3 :The inclining Desdemona to subdue : None
2.3 :In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful : None
2.3 :As the free elements. And then for her : None
2.3 :To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism, : None
2.3 :All seals and symbols of redeemed sin, : None
2.3 :His soul is so enfetter'd to her love, : None
2.3 :That she may make, unmake, do what she list, : None

2.3 :When devils will the blackest sins put on, : None
2.3 :They do suggest at first with heavenly shows, : None

2.3 :Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes : None
2.3 :And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor, : None
2.3 :I'll pour this pestilence into his ear, : None
2.3 :That she repeals him for her body's lust; : None
2.3 :And by how much she strives to do him good, : None
2.3 :She shall undo her credit with the Moor. : None

RODERIGO
2.3 :I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that : None

2.3 :have so much experience for my pains, and so, with : None
2.3 :no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice. : None
IAGO
2.3 :How poor are they that have not patience! : None
2.3 :What wound did ever heal but by degrees? : None

2.3 :Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee. : None
2.3 :And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio: : None
2.3 :Though other things grow fair against the sun, : None

CASSIO
3.3 :Bounteous madam, : None
3.3 :Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio, : None

3.3 :You have known him long; and be you well assured : None
3.3 :He shall in strangeness stand no further off : None
3.3 :Than in a polite distance. : None
CASSIO
3.3 :Ay, but, lady, : None
3.3 :That policy may either last so long, : None
3.3 :Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet, : None
3.3 :Or breed itself so out of circumstance, : None
3.3 :That, I being absent and my place supplied, : None
3.3 :My general will forget my love and service. : None
DESDEMONA
3.3 :Do not doubt that; before Emilia here : None
3.3 :I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee, : None
3.3 :If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it : None
3.3 :To the last article: my lord shall never rest; : None
3.3 :I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience; : None
3.3 :His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift; : None
3.3 :I'll intermingle every thing he does : None
3.3 :With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio; : None
3.3 :For thy solicitor shall rather die : None
3.3 :Than give thy cause away. : None
EMILIA
3.3 :Madam, here comes my lord. : None
CASSIO
3.3 :Madam, I'll take my leave. : None
DESDEMONA

OTHELLO
3.3 :What dost thou say? : None
IAGO
3.3 :Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :Was not that Cassio parted from my wife? : None
IAGO
3.3 :Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it, : None
3.3 :That he would steal away so guilty-like, : None
3.3 :Seeing you coming. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :                  I do believe 'twas he. : None
DESDEMONA
3.3 :How now, my lord! : None
3.3 :I have been talking with a suitor here, : None
3.3 :A man that languishes in your displeasure. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :Who is't you mean? : None
DESDEMONA
3.3 :Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord, : None
3.3 :If I have any grace or power to move you, : None
3.3 :His present reconciliation take; : None
3.3 :For if he be not one that truly loves you, : None
3.3 :That errs in ignorance and not in cunning, : None
3.3 :I have no judgment in an honest face: : None
3.3 :I prithee, call him back. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :Went he hence now? : None
DESDEMONA
3.3 :Ay, sooth; so humbled : None
3.3 :That he hath left part of his grief with me, : None
3.3 :To suffer with him. Good love, call him back. : None
OTHELLO

DESDEMONA
3.3 :Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn; : None
3.3 :On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn: : None
3.3 :I prithee, name the time, but let it not : None
3.3 :Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent; : None
3.3 :And yet his trespass, in our common reason-- : None
3.3 :Save that, they say, the wars must make examples : None
3.3 :Out of their best--is not almost a fault : None
3.3 :To incur a private cheque. When shall he come? : None
3.3 :Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul, : None
3.3 :What you would ask me, that I should deny, : None
3.3 :Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio, : None
3.3 :That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time, : None
3.3 :When I have spoke of you dispraisingly, : None
3.3 :Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do : None
3.3 :To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,-- : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :Prithee, no more: let him come when he will; : None
3.3 :I will deny thee nothing. : None
DESDEMONA
3.3 :Why, this is not a boon; : None
3.3 :'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves, : None
3.3 :Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm, : None
3.3 :Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit : None
3.3 :To your own person: nay, when I have a suit : None
3.3 :Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed, : None
3.3 :It shall be full of poise and difficult weight : None
3.3 :And fearful to be granted. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :I will deny thee nothing: : None
3.3 :Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this, : None
3.3 :To leave me but a little to myself. : None
DESDEMONA
3.3 :Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight. : None

3.3 :My noble lord-- : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :                  What dost thou say, Iago? : None
IAGO
3.3 :Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady, : None
3.3 :Know of your love? : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask? : None
IAGO
3.3 :But for a satisfaction of my thought; : None
3.3 :No further harm. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :                  Why of thy thought, Iago? : None
IAGO
3.3 :I did not think he had been acquainted with her. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :O, yes; and went between us very oft. : None
IAGO
3.3 :Indeed! : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that? : None
3.3 :Is he not honest? : None
IAGO
3.3 :Honest, my lord! : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :                  Honest! ay, honest. : None
IAGO
3.3 :My lord, for aught I know. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :What dost thou think? : None
IAGO
3.3 :Think, my lord! : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :Think, my lord! : None
3.3 :By heaven, he echoes me, : None
3.3 :As if there were some monster in his thought : None
3.3 :Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something: : None
3.3 :I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that, : None
3.3 :When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like? : None
3.3 :And when I told thee he was of my counsel : None
3.3 :In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!' : None
3.3 :And didst contract and purse thy brow together, : None
3.3 :As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain : None
3.3 :Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me, : None
3.3 :Show me thy thought. : None
IAGO
3.3 :My lord, you know I love you. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :I think thou dost; : None
3.3 :And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty, : None
3.3 :And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath, : None
3.3 :Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more: : None
3.3 :For such things in a false disloyal knave : None
3.3 :Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just : None
3.3 :They are close delations, working from the heart : None
3.3 :That passion cannot rule. : None
IAGO
3.3 :For Michael Cassio, : None
3.3 :I dare be sworn I think that he is honest. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :I think so too. : None
IAGO
3.3 :                  Men should be what they seem; : None
3.3 :Or those that be not, would they might seem none! : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :Certain, men should be what they seem. : None
IAGO
3.3 :Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :Nay, yet there's more in this: : None
3.3 :I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings, : None
3.3 :As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts : None
3.3 :The worst of words. : None
IAGO
3.3 :Good my lord, pardon me: : None
3.3 :Though I am bound to every act of duty, : None
3.3 :I am not bound to that all slaves are free to. : None
3.3 :Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false; : None
3.3 :As where's that palace whereinto foul things : None
3.3 :Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure, : None
3.3 :But some uncleanly apprehensions : None
3.3 :Keep leets and law-days and in session sit : None
3.3 :With meditations lawful? : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago, : None
3.3 :If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear : None
3.3 :A stranger to thy thoughts. : None
IAGO
3.3 :I do beseech you-- : None
3.3 :Though I perchance am vicious in my guess, : None
3.3 :As, I confess, it is my nature's plague : None
3.3 :To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy : None
3.3 :Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet, : None
3.3 :From one that so imperfectly conceits, : None
3.3 :Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble : None
3.3 :Out of his scattering and unsure observance. : None
3.3 :It were not for your quiet nor your good, : None
3.3 :Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom, : None
3.3 :To let you know my thoughts. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :What dost thou mean? : None
IAGO
3.3 :Good name in man and woman, dear my lord, : None
3.3 :Is the immediate jewel of their souls: : None
3.3 :Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing; : None
3.3 :'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands: : None
3.3 :But he that filches from me my good name : None
3.3 :Robs me of that which not enriches him : None
3.3 :And makes me poor indeed. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts. : None
IAGO
3.3 :You cannot, if my heart were in your hand; : None
3.3 :Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :Ha! : None
IAGO
3.3 :O, beware, my lord, of jealousy; : None
3.3 :It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock : None
3.3 :The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss : None
3.3 :Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger; : None
3.3 :But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er : None
3.3 :Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves! : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :O misery! : None
IAGO
3.3 :Poor and content is rich and rich enough, : None
3.3 :But riches fineless is as poor as winter : None
3.3 :To him that ever fears he shall be poor. : None
3.3 :Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend : None
3.3 :From jealousy! : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :                  Why, why is this? : None
3.3 :Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy, : None
3.3 :To follow still the changes of the moon : None
3.3 :With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt : None
3.3 :Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat, : None
3.3 :When I shall turn the business of my soul : None
3.3 :To such exsufflicate and blown surmises, : None
3.3 :Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous : None
3.3 :To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company, : None
3.3 :Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well; : None
3.3 :Where virtue is, these are more virtuous: : None
3.3 :Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw : None
3.3 :The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt; : None
3.3 :For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago; : None
3.3 :I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove; : None
3.3 :And on the proof, there is no more but this,-- : None
3.3 :Away at once with love or jealousy! : None
IAGO
3.3 :I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason : None
3.3 :To show the love and duty that I bear you : None
3.3 :With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound, : None
3.3 :Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof. : None
3.3 :Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio; : None
3.3 :Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure: : None
3.3 :I would not have your free and noble nature, : None
3.3 :Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't: : None
3.3 :I know our country disposition well; : None
3.3 :In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks : None
3.3 :They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience : None
3.3 :Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :Dost thou say so? : None
IAGO
3.3 :She did deceive her father, marrying you; : None
3.3 :And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks, : None
3.3 :She loved them most. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :And so she did. : None
IAGO
3.3 :Why, go to then; : None
3.3 :She that, so young, could give out such a seeming, : None
3.3 :To seal her father's eyes up close as oak- : None
3.3 :He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame; : None
3.3 :I humbly do beseech you of your pardon : None
3.3 :For too much loving you. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :I am bound to thee for ever. : None
IAGO
3.3 :I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :Not a jot, not a jot. : None
IAGO
3.3 :I' faith, I fear it has. : None
3.3 :I hope you will consider what is spoke : None
3.3 :Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved: : None
3.3 :I am to pray you not to strain my speech : None
3.3 :To grosser issues nor to larger reach : None
3.3 :Than to suspicion. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :I will not. : None
IAGO
3.3 :          Should you do so, my lord, : None
3.3 :My speech should fall into such vile success : None
3.3 :As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend-- : None
3.3 :My lord, I see you're moved. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :No, not much moved: : None
3.3 :I do not think but Desdemona's honest. : None
IAGO
3.3 :Long live she so! and long live you to think so! : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :And yet, how nature erring from itself,-- : None
IAGO
3.3 :Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you-- : None
3.3 :Not to affect many proposed matches : None
3.3 :Of her own clime, complexion, and degree, : None
3.3 :Whereto we see in all things nature tends-- : None
3.3 :Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank, : None
3.3 :Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural. : None
3.3 :But pardon me; I do not in position : None
3.3 :Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear : None
3.3 :Her will, recoiling to her better judgment, : None
3.3 :May fall to match you with her country forms : None
3.3 :And happily repent. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :Farewell, farewell: : None
3.3 :If more thou dost perceive, let me know more; : None
3.3 :Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago: : None

3.3 :  My lord, I take my leave. : Going : ['None - []'] : IAGO
OTHELLO
3.3 :Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless : None
3.3 :Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds. : None
IAGO
3.3 :  My lord, I would I might entreat : Returning : ['None - []'] : IAGO
3.3 :your honour : None
3.3 :To scan this thing no further; leave it to time: : None
3.3 :Though it be fit that Cassio have his place, : None
3.3 :For sure, he fills it up with great ability, : None
3.3 :Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile, : None
3.3 :You shall by that perceive him and his means: : None
3.3 :Note, if your lady strain his entertainment : None
3.3 :With any strong or vehement importunity; : None
3.3 :Much will be seen in that. In the mean time, : None
3.3 :Let me be thought too busy in my fears-- : None
3.3 :As worthy cause I have to fear I am-- : None
3.3 :And hold her free, I do beseech your honour. : None

3.3 :Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings, : None
3.3 :I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind, : None

3.3 :And have not those soft parts of conversation : None
3.3 :That chamberers have, or for I am declined : None
3.3 :Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much-- : None
3.3 :She's gone. I am abused; and my relief : None
3.3 :Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage, : None
3.3 :That we can call these delicate creatures ours, : None
3.3 :And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad, : None
3.3 :And live upon the vapour of a dungeon, : None
3.3 :Than keep a corner in the thing I love : None
3.3 :For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones; : None
3.3 :Prerogatived are they less than the base; : None
3.3 :'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death: : None

3.3 :I think my wife be honest and think she is not; : None
3.3 :I think that thou art just and think thou art not. : None
3.3 :I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh : None

3.3 :But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far, : None
3.3 :Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love, : None
3.3 :I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately; : None
3.3 :And, being troubled with a raging tooth, : None
3.3 :I could not sleep. : None
3.3 :There are a kind of men so loose of soul, : None
3.3 :That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs: : None
3.3 :One of this kind is Cassio: : None
3.3 :In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona, : None
3.3 :Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;' : None
3.3 :And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand, : None
3.3 :Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard, : None
3.3 :As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots : None
3.3 :That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg : None
3.3 :Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then : None
3.3 :Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!' : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :O monstrous! monstrous! : None
IAGO
3.3 :Nay, this was but his dream. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :But this denoted a foregone conclusion: : None
3.3 :'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream. : None
IAGO
3.3 :And this may help to thicken other proofs : None
3.3 :That do demonstrate thinly. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :I'll tear her all to pieces. : None
IAGO
3.3 :Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done; : None
3.3 :She may be honest yet. Tell me but this, : None
3.3 :Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief : None
3.3 :Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand? : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift. : None
IAGO
3.3 :I know not that; but such a handkerchief-- : None
3.3 :I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day : None
3.3 :See Cassio wipe his beard with. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :If it be that-- : None
IAGO
3.3 :If it be that, or any that was hers, : None
3.3 :It speaks against her with the other proofs. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :O, that the slave had forty thousand lives! : None
3.3 :One is too poor, too weak for my revenge. : None
3.3 :Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago; : None
3.3 :All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven. : None
3.3 :'Tis gone. : None
3.3 :Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell! : None
3.3 :Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne : None
3.3 :To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught, : None
3.3 :For 'tis of aspics' tongues! : None
IAGO
3.3 :Yet be content. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :O, blood, blood, blood! : None
IAGO
3.3 :Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea, : None
3.3 :Whose icy current and compulsive course : None
3.3 :Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on : None
3.3 :To the Propontic and the Hellespont, : None
3.3 :Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace, : None
3.3 :Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love, : None

3.3 :That Cassio's not alive. : None
IAGO
3.3 :My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request: : None
3.3 :But let her live. : None
OTHELLO
3.3 :Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her! : None
3.3 :Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw, : None

DESDEMONA
3.4 :                  You may, indeed, say so; : None
