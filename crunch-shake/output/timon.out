1.1 :All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer : None

APEMANTUS
1.1 :Are they not Athenians? : None
TIMON

APEMANTUS
1.1 :Then I repent not. : None
1.1 :Jeweller: You know me, Apemantus? : None

1.1 :To knock out an honest Athenian's brains. : None
TIMON
1.1 :That's a deed thou'lt die for. : None
APEMANTUS
1.1 :Right, if doing nothing be death by the law. : None
TIMON
1.1 :How likest thou this picture, Apemantus? : None
APEMANTUS
1.1 :The best, for the innocence. : None
TIMON
1.1 :Wrought he not well that painted it? : None
APEMANTUS
1.1 :He wrought better that made the painter; and yet : None
1.1 :he's but a filthy piece of work. : None
PAINTER
1.1 :You're a dog. : None
APEMANTUS
1.1 :Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog? : None
TIMON
1.1 :Wilt dine with me, Apemantus? : None
APEMANTUS
1.1 :No; I eat not lords. : None
TIMON
1.1 :An thou shouldst, thou 'ldst anger ladies. : None
APEMANTUS
1.1 :O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies. : None
TIMON
1.1 :That's a lascivious apprehension. : None
APEMANTUS
1.1 :So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour. : None
TIMON
1.1 :How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus? : None
APEMANTUS

1.1 :man a doit. : None
TIMON
1.1 :What dost thou think 'tis worth? : None

POET
1.1 :That's not feigned; he is so. : None
APEMANTUS
1.1 :Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy : None
1.1 :labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o' : None
1.1 :the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord! : None
TIMON
1.1 :What wouldst do then, Apemantus? : None
APEMANTUS

APEMANTUS
1.1 :                  So, so, there! : None
1.1 :Aches contract and starve your supple joints! : None
1.1 :That there should be small love 'mongst these : None
1.1 :sweet knaves, : None
1.1 :And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out : None
1.1 :Into baboon and monkey. : None
ALCIBIADES
1.1 :Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed : None
1.1 :Most hungerly on your sight. : None

1.1 :Hang thyself! : None
APEMANTUS

1.1 :requests to thy friend. : None
SECOND LORD

APEMANTUS
1.1 :I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' the ass. : None
Exit : ['Exit - []'] : APEMANTUS

1.1 :And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoes : None
1.1 :The very heart of kindness. : None
SECOND LORD
1.1 :He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold, : None
1.1 :Is but his steward: no meed, but he repays : None

Scene(scene=2)
Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet  served in; FLAVIUS and others attending; then enter  TIMON, ALCIBIADES, Lords, Senators, and VENTIDIUS.  Then comes, dropping, after all, APEMANTUS, discontentedly, like himself : ['None - []', "enter - ['FLAVIUS', 'TIMON', 'ALCIBIADES', 'SENATOR', 'VENTIDIUS']", "None - ['ALL', 'APEMANTUS']"] : FIRST LORD
VENTIDIUS
1.2 :Most honour'd Timon, : None
1.2 :It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age, : None
1.2 :And call him to long peace. : None
1.2 :He is gone happy, and has left me rich: : None
1.2 :Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound : None
1.2 :To your free heart, I do return those talents, : None
1.2 :Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help : None
1.2 :I derived liberty. : None
TIMON
1.2 :                  O, by no means, : None
1.2 :Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love: : None
1.2 :I gave it freely ever; and there's none : None
1.2 :Can truly say he gives, if he receives: : None
1.2 :If our betters play at that game, we must not dare : None
1.2 :To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair. : None
VENTIDIUS
1.2 :A noble spirit! : None
TIMON
1.2 :                  Nay, my lords, : None
They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON : ["None - ['ALL', 'TIMON']"] : TIMON
1.2 :Ceremony was but devised at first : None
1.2 :To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes, : None
1.2 :Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown; : None
1.2 :But where there is true friendship, there needs none. : None
1.2 :Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes : None
1.2 :Than my fortunes to me. : None
They sit : ['None - []'] : TIMON
FIRST LORD
1.2 :My lord, we always have confess'd it. : None
APEMANTUS
1.2 :Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not? : None
TIMON
1.2 :O, Apemantus, you are welcome. : None
APEMANTUS
1.2 :No; : None
1.2 :You shall not make me welcome: : None
1.2 :I come to have thee thrust me out of doors. : None
TIMON
1.2 :Fie, thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour there : None
1.2 :Does not become a man: 'tis much to blame. : None
1.2 :They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est;' but yond : None
1.2 :man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by : None
1.2 :himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is : None
1.2 :he fit for't, indeed. : None
APEMANTUS
1.2 :Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come to : None
1.2 :observe; I give thee warning on't. : None
TIMON
1.2 :I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian, : None
1.2 :therefore welcome: I myself would have no power; : None
1.2 :prithee, let my meat make thee silent. : None
APEMANTUS
1.2 :I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should : None
1.2 :ne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of : None
1.2 :men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves me : None
1.2 :to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood; : None
1.2 :and all the madness is, he cheers them up too. : None
1.2 :I wonder men dare trust themselves with men: : None
1.2 :Methinks they should invite them without knives; : None
1.2 :Good for their meat, and safer for their lives. : None
1.2 :There's much example for't; the fellow that sits : None
1.2 :next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the : None
1.2 :breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest : None
1.2 :man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a : None
1.2 :huge man, I should fear to drink at meals; : None
1.2 :Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes: : None
1.2 :Great men should drink with harness on their throats. : None
TIMON
1.2 :My lord, in heart; and let the health go round. : None
SECOND LORD
1.2 :Let it flow this way, my good lord. : None
APEMANTUS

FIRST STRANGER
3.2 :We know him for no less, though we are but strangers : None

3.2 :shrinks from him. : None
LUCILIUS
3.2 :Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money. : None
SECOND STRANGER
3.2 :But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago, : None

3.2 :so many talents, nay, urged extremely for't and : None

LUCILIUS
3.2 :How! : None
SECOND STRANGER
3.2 :I tell you, denied, my lord. : None
LUCILIUS

3.2 :there was very little honour showed in't. For my own : None
3.2 :part, I must needs confess, I have received some : None
3.2 :small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels : None

3.2 :May it please your honour, my lord hath sent-- : None
LUCILIUS

SERVILIUS
3.2 :Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord; : None

LUCILIUS
3.2 :I know his lordship is but merry with me; : None

3.2 :Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I : None

3.2 :because I have no power to be kind: and tell him : None
3.2 :this from me, I count it one of my greatest : None
3.2 :afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an : None
3.2 :honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you : None
3.2 :befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him? : None

3.2 :And kept his credit with his purse, : None
3.2 :Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money : None
3.2 :Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks, : None

3.2 :And yet--O, see the monstrousness of man : None
3.2 :When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!-- : None

3.2 :For mine own part, : None
3.2 :I never tasted Timon in my life, : None

3.3 :Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like : None

3.3 :Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him, : None
3.3 :That might have known my place: I see no sense for't, : None
3.3 :But his occasion might have woo'd me first; : None
3.3 :For, in my conscience, I was the first man : None
3.3 :That e'er received gift from him: : None
3.3 :And does he think so backwardly of me now, : None
3.3 :That I'll requite its last? No: : None

5.1 :for true, that he's so full of gold? : None
PAINTER
5.1 :Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and : None

5.1 :straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said : None
5.1 :he gave unto his steward a mighty sum. : None
POET
5.1 :Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends. : None
PAINTER
5.1 :Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens : None

5.1 :'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this : None

PAINTER
5.1 :Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the : None

5.1 :performance is ever the duller for his act; and, : None
5.1 :but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the : None
5.1 :deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is : None
