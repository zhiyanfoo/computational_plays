1.2 :Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them. : None
1.2 :The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch, : None
1.2 :But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek, : None

1.2 :With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel, : None
1.2 :Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her, : None
1.2 :Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock : None
1.2 :Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd. : None
1.2 :Had I been any god of power, I would : None
1.2 :Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere : None
1.2 :It should the good ship so have swallow'd and : None

1.2 :Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing : None
1.2 :Of whence I am, nor that I am more better : None
1.2 :Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell, : None

PROSPERO
1.2 :The hour's now come; : None
1.2 :The very minute bids thee ope thine ear; : None
1.2 :Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember : None

1.2 :I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not : None
1.2 :Out three years old. : None
MIRANDA

1.2 :Of any thing the image tell me that : None
1.2 :Hath kept with thy remembrance. : None
MIRANDA
1.2 :'Tis far off : None
1.2 :And rather like a dream than an assurance : None
1.2 :That my remembrance warrants. Had I not : None
1.2 :Four or five women once that tended me? : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it : None
1.2 :That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else : None
1.2 :In the dark backward and abysm of time? : None
1.2 :If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here, : None
1.2 :How thou camest here thou mayst. : None

MIRANDA
1.2 :O the heavens! : None
1.2 :What foul play had we, that we came from thence? : None
1.2 :Or blessed was't we did? : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :Both, both, my girl: : None
1.2 :By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence, : None
1.2 :But blessedly holp hither. : None
MIRANDA

1.2 :Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself : None
1.2 :Of all the world I loved and to him put : None
1.2 :The manage of my state; as at that time : None
1.2 :Through all the signories it was the first : None
1.2 :And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed : None
1.2 :In dignity, and for the liberal arts : None
1.2 :Without a parallel; those being all my study, : None
1.2 :The government I cast upon my brother : None
1.2 :And to my state grew stranger, being transported : None
1.2 :And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle-- : None
1.2 :Dost thou attend me? : None
MIRANDA
1.2 :Sir, most heedfully. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :Being once perfected how to grant suits, : None
1.2 :How to deny them, who to advance and who : None
1.2 :To trash for over-topping, new created : None
1.2 :The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em, : None
1.2 :Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key : None
1.2 :Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state : None
1.2 :To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was : None
1.2 :The ivy which had hid my princely trunk, : None
1.2 :And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not. : None
MIRANDA
1.2 :O, good sir, I do. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :                  I pray thee, mark me. : None
1.2 :I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated : None
1.2 :To closeness and the bettering of my mind : None
1.2 :With that which, but by being so retired, : None
1.2 :O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother : None
1.2 :Awaked an evil nature; and my trust, : None
1.2 :Like a good parent, did beget of him : None
1.2 :A falsehood in its contrary as great : None
1.2 :As my trust was; which had indeed no limit, : None
1.2 :A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded, : None
1.2 :Not only with what my revenue yielded, : None
1.2 :But what my power might else exact, like one : None
1.2 :Who having into truth, by telling of it, : None
1.2 :Made such a sinner of his memory, : None
1.2 :To credit his own lie, he did believe : None
1.2 :He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution : None
1.2 :And executing the outward face of royalty, : None
1.2 :With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing-- : None
1.2 :Dost thou hear? : None
MIRANDA
1.2 :                  Your tale, sir, would cure deafness. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :To have no screen between this part he play'd : None
1.2 :And him he play'd it for, he needs will be : None
1.2 :Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library : None
1.2 :Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties : None
1.2 :He thinks me now incapable; confederates-- : None
1.2 :So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples : None
1.2 :To give him annual tribute, do him homage, : None
1.2 :Subject his coronet to his crown and bend : None
1.2 :The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!-- : None
1.2 :To most ignoble stooping. : None
MIRANDA
1.2 :O the heavens! : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :Mark his condition and the event; then tell me : None
1.2 :If this might be a brother. : None
MIRANDA
1.2 :I should sin : None
1.2 :To think but nobly of my grandmother: : None
1.2 :Good wombs have borne bad sons. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :Now the condition. : None
1.2 :The King of Naples, being an enemy : None
1.2 :To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit; : None
1.2 :Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises : None
1.2 :Of homage and I know not how much tribute, : None
1.2 :Should presently extirpate me and mine : None
1.2 :Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan : None
1.2 :With all the honours on my brother: whereon, : None
1.2 :A treacherous army levied, one midnight : None
1.2 :Fated to the purpose did Antonio open : None
1.2 :The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness, : None
1.2 :The ministers for the purpose hurried thence : None
1.2 :Me and thy crying self. : None
MIRANDA
1.2 :Alack, for pity! : None
1.2 :I, not remembering how I cried out then, : None
1.2 :Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint : None
1.2 :That wrings mine eyes to't. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :Hear a little further : None
1.2 :And then I'll bring thee to the present business : None
1.2 :Which now's upon's; without the which this story : None
1.2 :Were most impertinent. : None
MIRANDA
1.2 :Wherefore did they not : None
1.2 :That hour destroy us? : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :Well demanded, wench: : None
1.2 :My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not, : None
1.2 :So dear the love my people bore me, nor set : None
1.2 :A mark so bloody on the business, but : None
1.2 :With colours fairer painted their foul ends. : None
1.2 :In few, they hurried us aboard a bark, : None
1.2 :Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared : None
1.2 :A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd, : None
1.2 :Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats : None
1.2 :Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us, : None
1.2 :To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh : None
1.2 :To the winds whose pity, sighing back again, : None
1.2 :Did us but loving wrong. : None
MIRANDA
1.2 :Alack, what trouble : None
1.2 :Was I then to you! : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :                  O, a cherubim : None
1.2 :Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile. : None
1.2 :Infused with a fortitude from heaven, : None
1.2 :When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt, : None
1.2 :Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me : None
1.2 :An undergoing stomach, to bear up : None
1.2 :Against what should ensue. : None
MIRANDA
1.2 :How came we ashore? : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :By Providence divine. : None
1.2 :Some food we had and some fresh water that : None
1.2 :A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo, : None
1.2 :Out of his charity, being then appointed : None
1.2 :Master of this design, did give us, with : None
1.2 :Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries, : None
1.2 :Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness, : None
1.2 :Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me : None
1.2 :From mine own library with volumes that : None
1.2 :I prize above my dukedom. : None
MIRANDA
1.2 :Would I might : None
1.2 :But ever see that man! : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :Now I arise: : None
Resumes his mantle : ['None - []'] : PROSPERO
1.2 :Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow. : None
1.2 :Here in this island we arrived; and here : None
1.2 :Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit : None
1.2 :Than other princesses can that have more time : None
1.2 :For vainer hours and tutors not so careful. : None
MIRANDA
1.2 :Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir, : None
1.2 :For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason : None
1.2 :For raising this sea-storm? : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :Know thus far forth. : None
1.2 :By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune, : None
1.2 :Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies : None
1.2 :Brought to this shore; and by my prescience : None
1.2 :I find my zenith doth depend upon : None
1.2 :A most auspicious star, whose influence : None
1.2 :If now I court not but omit, my fortunes : None
1.2 :Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions: : None
1.2 :Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness, : None
1.2 :And give it way: I know thou canst not choose. : None
MIRANDA sleeps : ["None - ['MIRANDA']"] : PROSPERO

Enter ARIEL : ["Enter - ['ARIEL']"] : PROSPERO
ARIEL
1.2 :All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come : None
1.2 :To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly, : None
1.2 :To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride : None
1.2 :On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task : None
1.2 :Ariel and all his quality. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :Hast thou, spirit, : None
1.2 :Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee? : None
ARIEL
1.2 :To every article. : None
1.2 :I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak, : None
1.2 :Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin, : None
1.2 :I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide, : None
1.2 :And burn in many places; on the topmast, : None
1.2 :The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly, : None
1.2 :Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors : None
1.2 :O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary : None
1.2 :And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks : None
1.2 :Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune : None
1.2 :Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble, : None
1.2 :Yea, his dread trident shake. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :My brave spirit! : None
1.2 :Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil : None
1.2 :Would not infect his reason? : None
ARIEL
1.2 :Not a soul : None
1.2 :But felt a fever of the mad and play'd : None
1.2 :Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners : None
1.2 :Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel, : None
1.2 :Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand, : None
1.2 :With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,-- : None
1.2 :Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty : None
1.2 :And all the devils are here.' : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :Why that's my spirit! : None
1.2 :But was not this nigh shore? : None
ARIEL
1.2 :Close by, my master. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :But are they, Ariel, safe? : None
ARIEL
1.2 :Not a hair perish'd; : None
1.2 :On their sustaining garments not a blemish, : None
1.2 :But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me, : None
1.2 :In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle. : None
1.2 :The king's son have I landed by himself; : None
1.2 :Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs : None
1.2 :In an odd angle of the isle and sitting, : None
1.2 :His arms in this sad knot. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :Of the king's ship : None
1.2 :The mariners say how thou hast disposed : None
1.2 :And all the rest o' the fleet. : None
ARIEL
1.2 :Safely in harbour : None
1.2 :Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once : None
1.2 :Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew : None
1.2 :From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid: : None
1.2 :The mariners all under hatches stow'd; : None
1.2 :Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour, : None
1.2 :I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet : None
1.2 :Which I dispersed, they all have met again : None
1.2 :And are upon the Mediterranean flote, : None
1.2 :Bound sadly home for Naples, : None
1.2 :Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd : None
1.2 :And his great person perish. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :Ariel, thy charge : None
1.2 :Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work. : None
1.2 :What is the time o' the day? : None
ARIEL
1.2 :Past the mid season. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now : None
1.2 :Must by us both be spent most preciously. : None
ARIEL
1.2 :Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains, : None
1.2 :Let me remember thee what thou hast promised, : None
1.2 :Which is not yet perform'd me. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :How now? moody? : None
1.2 :What is't thou canst demand? : None
ARIEL
1.2 :My liberty. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :Before the time be out? no more! : None
ARIEL
1.2 :I prithee, : None
1.2 :Remember I have done thee worthy service; : None
1.2 :Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served : None
1.2 :Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise : None
1.2 :To bate me a full year. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :Dost thou forget : None
1.2 :From what a torment I did free thee? : None
ARIEL
1.2 :No. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze : None
1.2 :Of the salt deep, : None
1.2 :To run upon the sharp wind of the north, : None
1.2 :To do me business in the veins o' the earth : None
1.2 :When it is baked with frost. : None
ARIEL
1.2 :I do not, sir. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot : None
1.2 :The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy : None
1.2 :Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her? : None
ARIEL
1.2 :No, sir. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :     Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me. : None
ARIEL
1.2 :Sir, in Argier. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :                  O, was she so? I must : None
1.2 :Once in a month recount what thou hast been, : None
1.2 :Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax, : None
1.2 :For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible : None
1.2 :To enter human hearing, from Argier, : None
1.2 :Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did : None
1.2 :They would not take her life. Is not this true? : None
ARIEL
1.2 :Ay, sir. : None
PROSPERO
1.2 :This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child : None
1.2 :And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave, : None
1.2 :As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant; : None
1.2 :And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate : None
1.2 :To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands, : None
1.2 :Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee, : None
1.2 :By help of her more potent ministers : None
1.2 :And in her most unmitigable rage, : None

2.1 :By all of us, and the fair soul herself : None
2.1 :Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at : None

SEBASTIAN

2.1 :Do you not hear me speak? : None
SEBASTIAN
2.1 :I do; and surely : None
2.1 :It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st : None

SEBASTIAN
2.1 :I remember : None
2.1 :You did supplant your brother Prospero. : None
ANTONIO
2.1 :True: : None
2.1 :And look how well my garments sit upon me; : None
2.1 :Much feater than before: my brother's servants : None

SEBASTIAN
2.1 :But, for your conscience? : None
ANTONIO
2.1 :Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe, : None

SEBASTIAN
2.1 :Thy case, dear friend, : None
2.1 :Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan, : None

GONZALO
2.1 :What's the matter? : None
SEBASTIAN
2.1 :Whiles we stood here securing your repose, : None
2.1 :Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing : None
2.1 :Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you? : None
2.1 :It struck mine ear most terribly. : None
ALONSO
2.1 :I heard nothing. : None
ANTONIO
