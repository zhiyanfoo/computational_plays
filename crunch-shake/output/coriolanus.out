FIRST CITIZEN
1.1 :We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good. : None

1.1 :would yield us but the superfluity, while it were : None
1.1 :wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely; : None
1.1 :but they think we are too dear: the leanness that : None
1.1 :afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an : None
1.1 :inventory to particularise their abundance; our : None
1.1 :sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with : None
1.1 :our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I : None

SECOND CITIZEN

SECOND CITIZEN

SECOND CITIZEN

1.1 :is, even till the altitude of his virtue. : None
SECOND CITIZEN
1.1 :What he cannot help in his nature, you account a : None

FIRST CITIZEN
1.1 :Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have : None
1.1 :had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do, : None
1.1 :which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor : None

FIRST CITIZEN

1.1 :Against the Roman state, whose course will on : None
1.1 :The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs : None
1.1 :Of more strong link asunder than can ever : None
1.1 :Appear in your impediment. For the dearth, : None
1.1 :The gods, not the patricians, make it, and : None

1.1 :The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers, : None
1.1 :When you curse them as enemies. : None
FIRST CITIZEN
1.1 :Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us : None
1.1 :yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses : None
1.1 :crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to : None
1.1 :support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act : None
1.1 :established against the rich, and provide more : None
1.1 :piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain : None

1.1 :there's all the love they bear us. : None
MENENIUS
1.1 :Either you must : None
1.1 :Confess yourselves wondrous malicious, : None
1.1 :Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you : None
1.1 :A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it; : None
1.1 :But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture : None
1.1 :To stale 't a little more. : None
FIRST CITIZEN

MENENIUS

1.1 :That only like a gulf it did remain : None
1.1 :I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive, : None
1.1 :Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing : None

1.1 :Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel, : None
1.1 :And, mutually participate, did minister : None
1.1 :Unto the appetite and affection common : None
1.1 :Of the whole body. The belly answer'd-- : None
FIRST CITIZEN
1.1 :Well, sir, what answer made the belly? : None
MENENIUS
1.1 :Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile, : None
1.1 :Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus-- : None
1.1 :For, look you, I may make the belly smile : None
1.1 :As well as speak--it tauntingly replied : None
1.1 :To the discontented members, the mutinous parts : None
1.1 :That envied his receipt; even so most fitly : None
1.1 :As you malign our senators for that : None
1.1 :They are not such as you. : None
FIRST CITIZEN
1.1 :Your belly's answer? What! : None
1.1 :The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye, : None
1.1 :The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier, : None
1.1 :Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter. : None
1.1 :With other muniments and petty helps : None

MENENIUS
1.1 :Well, what then? : None
FIRST CITIZEN
1.1 :The former agents, if they did complain, : None
1.1 :What could the belly answer? : None
MENENIUS
1.1 :I will tell you : None
1.1 :If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little-- : None
1.1 :Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer. : None
FIRST CITIZEN
1.1 :Ye're long about it. : None
MENENIUS
1.1 :Note me this, good friend; : None
1.1 :Your most grave belly was deliberate, : None
1.1 :Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd: : None
1.1 :'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he, : None
1.1 :'That I receive the general food at first, : None
1.1 :Which you do live upon; and fit it is, : None
1.1 :Because I am the store-house and the shop : None
1.1 :Of the whole body: but, if you do remember, : None
1.1 :I send it through the rivers of your blood, : None
1.1 :Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain; : None
1.1 :And, through the cranks and offices of man, : None
1.1 :The strongest nerves and small inferior veins : None
1.1 :From me receive that natural competency : None
1.1 :Whereby they live: and though that all at once, : None
1.1 :You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,-- : None
FIRST CITIZEN
1.1 :Ay, sir; well, well. : None
MENENIUS
1.1 :'Though all at once cannot : None
1.1 :See what I do deliver out to each, : None
1.1 :Yet I can make my audit up, that all : None
1.1 :From me do back receive the flour of all, : None
1.1 :And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't? : None
FIRST CITIZEN
1.1 :It was an answer: how apply you this? : None
MENENIUS
1.1 :The senators of Rome are this good belly, : None
1.1 :And you the mutinous members; for examine : None
1.1 :Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly : None
1.1 :Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find : None
1.1 :No public benefit which you receive : None
1.1 :But it proceeds or comes from them to you : None
1.1 :And no way from yourselves. What do you think, : None
1.1 :You, the great toe of this assembly? : None
FIRST CITIZEN
1.1 :I the great toe! why the great toe? : None
MENENIUS
1.1 :For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest, : None
1.1 :Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost: : None
1.1 :Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run, : None
1.1 :Lead'st first to win some vantage. : None
1.1 :But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs: : None
1.1 :Rome and her rats are at the point of battle; : None
1.1 :The one side must have bale. : None
Enter CAIUS MARCIUS : ["Enter - ['MARCIUS']"] : MENENIUS
1.1 :Hail, noble Marcius! : None
MARCIUS

1.1 :That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion, : None
1.1 :Make yourselves scabs? : None
FIRST CITIZEN
1.1 :We have ever your good word. : None
MARCIUS
1.1 :He that will give good words to thee will flatter : None
1.1 :Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs, : None
1.1 :That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you, : None
1.1 :The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you, : None
1.1 :Where he should find you lions, finds you hares; : None
1.1 :Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no, : None
1.1 :Than is the coal of fire upon the ice, : None
1.1 :Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is : None
1.1 :To make him worthy whose offence subdues him : None
1.1 :And curse that justice did it. : None
1.1 :Who deserves greatness : None
1.1 :Deserves your hate; and your affections are : None
1.1 :A sick man's appetite, who desires most that : None
1.1 :Which would increase his evil. He that depends : None
1.1 :Upon your favours swims with fins of lead : None
1.1 :And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye? : None
1.1 :With every minute you do change a mind, : None
1.1 :And call him noble that was now your hate, : None
1.1 :Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter, : None
1.1 :That in these several places of the city : None
1.1 :You cry against the noble senate, who, : None
1.1 :Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else : None
1.1 :Would feed on one another? What's their seeking? : None
MENENIUS
1.1 :For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say, : None
1.1 :The city is well stored. : None
MARCIUS
1.1 :Hang 'em! They say! : None
1.1 :They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know : None
1.1 :What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise, : None
1.1 :Who thrives and who declines; side factions : None
1.1 :and give out : None
1.1 :Conjectural marriages; making parties strong : None
1.1 :And feebling such as stand not in their liking : None
1.1 :Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's : None
1.1 :grain enough! : None
1.1 :Would the nobility lay aside their ruth, : None
1.1 :And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry : None
1.1 :With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high : None
1.1 :As I could pick my lance. : None
MENENIUS
1.1 :Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded; : None
1.1 :For though abundantly they lack discretion, : None
1.1 :Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you, : None
1.1 :What says the other troop? : None
MARCIUS
1.1 :They are dissolved: hang 'em! : None
1.1 :They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs, : None
1.1 :That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat, : None
1.1 :That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not : None
1.1 :Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds : None
1.1 :They vented their complainings; which being answer'd, : None
1.1 :And a petition granted them, a strange one-- : None
1.1 :To break the heart of generosity, : None
1.1 :And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps : None
1.1 :As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon, : None
1.1 :Shouting their emulation. : None
MENENIUS
1.1 :What is granted them? : None
MARCIUS
1.1 :Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms, : None
1.1 :Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus, : None
1.1 :Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath! : None
1.1 :The rabble should have first unroof'd the city, : None
1.1 :Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time : None
1.1 :Win upon power and throw forth greater themes : None
1.1 :For insurrection's arguing. : None
MENENIUS
1.1 :This is strange. : None
MARCIUS
1.1 :Go, get you home, you fragments! : None

Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people, SICINIUS and BRUTUS. : ["Enter - ['MENENIUS', 'SICINIUS', 'BRUTUS']", 'None - []'] : FIRST SOLDIER
MENENIUS
2.1 :The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night. : None
BRUTUS
2.1 :Good or bad? : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :Not according to the prayer of the people, for they : None
2.1 :love not Marcius. : None
SICINIUS
2.1 :Nature teaches beasts to know their friends. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :Pray you, who does the wolf love? : None
SICINIUS
2.1 :The lamb. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the : None
2.1 :noble Marcius. : None
BRUTUS
2.1 :He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two : None
2.1 :are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you. : None
BOTH
2.1 :Well, sir. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two : None
2.1 :have not in abundance? : None
BRUTUS
2.1 :He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all. : None
SICINIUS
2.1 :Especially in pride. : None
BRUTUS
2.1 :And topping all others in boasting. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :This is strange now: do you two know how you are : None
2.1 :censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the : None
2.1 :right-hand file? do you? : None
BOTH
2.1 :Why, how are we censured? : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry? : None
BOTH
2.1 :Well, well, sir, well. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of : None
2.1 :occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience: : None
2.1 :give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at : None
2.1 :your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a : None
2.1 :pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for : None
2.1 :being proud? : None
BRUTUS
2.1 :We do it not alone, sir. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :I know you can do very little alone; for your helps : None
2.1 :are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous : None
2.1 :single: your abilities are too infant-like for : None
2.1 :doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you : None
2.1 :could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks, : None
2.1 :and make but an interior survey of your good selves! : None
2.1 :O that you could! : None
BRUTUS
2.1 :What then, sir? : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting, : None
2.1 :proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as : None
2.1 :any in Rome. : None
SICINIUS
2.1 :Menenius, you are known well enough too. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that : None
2.1 :loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying : None
2.1 :Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in : None
2.1 :favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like : None
2.1 :upon too trivial motion; one that converses more : None
2.1 :with the buttock of the night than with the forehead : None
2.1 :of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my : None
2.1 :malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as : None
2.1 :you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink : None
2.1 :you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a : None
2.1 :crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have : None
2.1 :delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in : None
2.1 :compound with the major part of your syllables: and : None
2.1 :though I must be content to bear with those that say : None
2.1 :you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that : None
2.1 :tell you you have good faces. If you see this in : None
2.1 :the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known : None
2.1 :well enough too? what barm can your bisson : None
2.1 :conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be : None
2.1 :known well enough too? : None
BRUTUS
2.1 :Come, sir, come, we know you well enough. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You : None
2.1 :are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you : None
2.1 :wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a : None
2.1 :cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller; : None
2.1 :and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a : None
2.1 :second day of audience. When you are hearing a : None
2.1 :matter between party and party, if you chance to be : None
2.1 :pinched with the colic, you make faces like : None
2.1 :mummers; set up the bloody flag against all : None
2.1 :patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot, : None
2.1 :dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled : None
2.1 :by your hearing: all the peace you make in their : None
2.1 :cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are : None
2.1 :a pair of strange ones. : None
BRUTUS
2.1 :Come, come, you are well understood to be a : None
2.1 :perfecter giber for the table than a necessary : None
2.1 :bencher in the Capitol. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall : None
2.1 :encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When : None
2.1 :you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the : None
2.1 :wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not : None
2.1 :so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's : None
2.1 :cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack- : None
2.1 :saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud; : None
2.1 :who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors : None
2.1 :since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the : None
2.1 :best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to : None
2.1 :your worships: more of your conversation would : None
2.1 :infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly : None
2.1 :plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you. : None

2.1 :How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon, : None
2.1 :were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow : None
2.1 :your eyes so fast? : None
VOLUMNIA
2.1 :Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for : None
2.1 :the love of Juno, let's go. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :Ha! Marcius coming home! : None
VOLUMNIA
2.1 :Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous : None

MENENIUS
2.1 :Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo! : None
2.1 :Marcius coming home! : None
VOLUMNIA
VIRGILIA
2.1 :Nay,'tis true. : None
VOLUMNIA
2.1 :Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath : None
2.1 :another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one : None
2.1 :at home for you. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for : None
2.1 :me! : None
VIRGILIA
2.1 :Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven : None
2.1 :years' health; in which time I will make a lip at : None
2.1 :the physician: the most sovereign prescription in : None
2.1 :Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative, : None
2.1 :of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he : None
2.1 :not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded. : None
VIRGILIA
2.1 :O, no, no, no. : None
VOLUMNIA
2.1 :O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a' : None
2.1 :victory in his pocket? the wounds become him. : None
VOLUMNIA
2.1 :On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home : None
2.1 :with the oaken garland. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly? : None
VOLUMNIA
2.1 :Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but : None
2.1 :Aufidius got off. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that: : None
2.1 :an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so : None
2.1 :fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold : None
2.1 :that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this? : None
VOLUMNIA
2.1 :Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate : None
2.1 :has letters from the general, wherein he gives my : None
2.1 :son the whole name of the war: he hath in this : None
2.1 :action outdone his former deeds doubly : None
VALERIA
2.1 :In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his : None
2.1 :true purchasing. : None
VIRGILIA
2.1 :The gods grant them true! : None
VOLUMNIA
2.1 :True! pow, wow. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :True! I'll be sworn they are true. : None
2.1 :Where is he wounded? : None
To the Tribunes : ['To - []'] : MENENIUS
2.1 :God save your good worships! Marcius is coming : None
2.1 :home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded? : None
VOLUMNIA
2.1 :I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be : None
2.1 :large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall : None
2.1 :stand for his place. He received in the repulse of : None
2.1 :Tarquin seven hurts i' the body. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's : None
2.1 :nine that I know. : None
VOLUMNIA
2.1 :He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five : None
2.1 :wounds upon him. : None
MENENIUS
2.1 :Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave. : None
A shout and flourish : ['None - []'] : MENENIUS
2.1 :Hark! the trumpets. : None
VOLUMNIA
2.1 :These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he : None
2.1 :carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears: : None
2.1 :Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie; : None
2.1 :Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die. : None

Enter a Messenger : ["Enter - ['MESSENGER']"] : SICINIUS
BRUTUS
2.1 :What's the matter? : None
MESSENGER
2.1 :You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought : None
2.1 :That Marcius shall be consul: : None
2.1 :I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and : None
2.1 :The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves, : None
2.1 :Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers, : None
2.1 :Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended, : None
2.1 :As to Jove's statue, and the commons made : None
2.1 :A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts: : None
2.1 :I never saw the like. : None
BRUTUS
2.1 :Let's to the Capitol; : None
2.1 :And carry with us ears and eyes for the time, : None

Enter two Officers, to lay cushions : ["Enter - ['OFFICER']"] : SICINIUS
FIRST OFFICER
2.2 :Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand : None
2.2 :for consulships? : None
SECOND OFFICER
2.2 :Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one : None
2.2 :Coriolanus will carry it. : None
FIRST OFFICER
2.2 :That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and : None
2.2 :loves not the common people. : None
SECOND OFFICER
2.2 :Faith, there had been many great men that have : None
2.2 :flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there : None
2.2 :be many that they have loved, they know not : None
2.2 :wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why, : None
2.2 :they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for : None
2.2 :Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate : None
2.2 :him manifests the true knowledge he has in their : None
2.2 :disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets : None
2.2 :them plainly see't. : None
FIRST OFFICER
2.2 :If he did not care whether he had their love or no, : None
2.2 :he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither : None
2.2 :good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater : None
2.2 :devotion than can render it him; and leaves : None
2.2 :nothing undone that may fully discover him their : None
2.2 :opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and : None
2.2 :displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he : None
2.2 :dislikes, to flatter them for their love. : None
SECOND OFFICER
2.2 :He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his : None
2.2 :ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who, : None
2.2 :having been supple and courteous to the people, : None
2.2 :bonneted, without any further deed to have them at : None
2.2 :an into their estimation and report: but he hath so : None
2.2 :planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions : None
2.2 :in their hearts, that for their tongues to be : None
2.2 :silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of : None
2.2 :ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a : None
2.2 :malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck : None
2.2 :reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it. : None
FIRST OFFICER
2.2 :No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they : None
2.2 :are coming. : None

BRUTUS

2.2 :I would you rather had been silent. Please you : None

BRUTUS
2.2 :Most willingly; : None
2.2 :But yet my caution was more pertinent : None
2.2 :Than the rebuke you give it. : None

CORIOLANUS
2.2 :No, sir: yet oft, : None

MENENIUS
2.2 :Pray now, sit down. : None
CORIOLANUS
2.2 :I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun : None

2.2 :Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter-- : None
2.2 :That's thousand to one good one--when you now see : None
2.2 :He had rather venture all his limbs for honour : None
2.2 :Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius. : None
COMINIUS
2.2 :I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus : None
2.2 :Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held : None
2.2 :That valour is the chiefest virtue, and : None
2.2 :Most dignifies the haver: if it be, : None
2.2 :The man I speak of cannot in the world : None
2.2 :Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years, : None

2.2 :When he might act the woman in the scene, : None
2.2 :He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed : None
2.2 :Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age : None
2.2 :Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea, : None
2.2 :And in the brunt of seventeen battles since : None
2.2 :He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last, : None
2.2 :Before and in Corioli, let me say, : None
2.2 :I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers; : None
2.2 :And by his rare example made the coward : None

FIRST SENATOR
2.2 :He cannot but with measure fit the honours : None

COMINIUS
2.2 :Our spoils he kick'd at, : None

THIRD CITIZEN
2.3 :We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a : None
2.3 :power that we have no power to do; for if he show us : None
2.3 :his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our : None
2.3 :tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if : None
2.3 :he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him : None
2.3 :our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is : None

THIRD CITIZEN
2.3 :We have been called so of many; not that our heads : None

2.3 :truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of : None

2.3 :and their consent of one direct way should be at : None

2.3 :Certainly : None
2.3 :He flouted us downright. : None
FIRST CITIZEN
2.3 :No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us. : None
SECOND CITIZEN
2.3 :Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says : None
2.3 :He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us : None
2.3 :His marks of merit, wounds received for's country. : None
SICINIUS
2.3 :Why, so he did, I am sure. : None
CITIZENS
2.3 :No, no; no man saw 'em. : None
THIRD CITIZEN
2.3 :He said he had wounds, which he could show : None
2.3 :in private; : None

2.3 :'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom, : None
2.3 :But by your voices, will not so permit me; : None

2.3 :Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you: : None
2.3 :Your most sweet voices: now you have left : None
2.3 :your voices, : None
2.3 :I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery? : None
SICINIUS

2.3 :If he should still malignantly remain : None

SICINIUS
2.3 :Thus to have said, : None

2.3 :When he did need your loves, and do you think : None
2.3 :That his contempt shall not be bruising to you, : None

2.3 :Their liberties; make them of no more voice : None
2.3 :Than dogs that are as often beat for barking : None
2.3 :As therefore kept to do so. : None
SICINIUS
2.3 :Let them assemble, : None
2.3 :And on a safer judgment all revoke : None
2.3 :Your ignorant election; enforce his pride, : None

2.3 :Cast your election on him. : None
SICINIUS
2.3 :Say, you chose him : None
2.3 :More after our commandment than as guided : None
2.3 :By your own true affections, and that your minds, : None
2.3 :Preoccupied with what you rather must do : None
2.3 :Than what you should, made you against the grain : None
2.3 :To voice him consul: lay the fault on us. : None
BRUTUS

2.3 :One thus descended, : None
2.3 :That hath beside well in his person wrought : None
2.3 :To be set high in place, we did commend : None
2.3 :To your remembrances: but you have found, : None
2.3 :Scaling his present bearing with his past, : None
2.3 :That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke : None
2.3 :Your sudden approbation. : None
BRUTUS
2.3 :Say, you ne'er had done't-- : None
2.3 :Harp on that still--but by our putting on; : None
2.3 :And presently, when you have drawn your number, : None

3.1 :That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war, : None
3.1 :Even when the navel of the state was touch'd, : None

MENENIUS

4.5 :What is thy name? : None
CORIOLANUS
4.5 :A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears, : None
4.5 :And harsh in sound to thine. : None
AUFIDIUS
4.5 :Say, what's thy name? : None
4.5 :Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face : None

4.5 :Permitted by our dastard nobles, who : None
4.5 :Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest; : None
4.5 :And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be : None
4.5 :Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity : None
4.5 :Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope-- : None
4.5 :Mistake me not--to save my life, for if : None
4.5 :I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world : None
4.5 :I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite, : None
4.5 :To be full quit of those my banishers, : None

4.5 :Which not to cut would show thee but a fool, : None

AUFIDIUS
4.5 :O Marcius, Marcius! : None
4.5 :Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart : None

4.5 :Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart : None
4.5 :Than when I first my wedded mistress saw : None

4.5 :Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out : None
4.5 :Twelve several times, and I have nightly since : None
4.5 :Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me; : None
4.5 :We have been down together in my sleep, : None
4.5 :Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat, : None
4.5 :And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius, : None
4.5 :Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that : None
4.5 :Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all : None
4.5 :From twelve to seventy, and pouring war : None
4.5 :Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome, : None

FIRST SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Here's a strange alteration! : None
SECOND SERVINGMAN
4.5 :By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with : None
4.5 :a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a : None
4.5 :false report of him. : None
FIRST SERVINGMAN
4.5 :What an arm he has! he turned me about with his : None
4.5 :finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top. : None
SECOND SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in : None
4.5 :him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I : None
4.5 :cannot tell how to term it. : None
FIRST SERVINGMAN
4.5 :He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged, : None
4.5 :but I thought there was more in him than I could think. : None
SECOND SERVINGMAN
4.5 :So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest : None
4.5 :man i' the world. : None
FIRST SERVINGMAN
4.5 :I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on. : None
SECOND SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Who, my master? : None
FIRST SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Nay, it's no matter for that. : None
SECOND SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Worth six on him. : None
FIRST SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the : None
4.5 :greater soldier. : None
SECOND SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that: : None
4.5 :for the defence of a town, our general is excellent. : None

THIRD SERVINGMAN
4.5 :I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as : None

FIRST SERVINGMAN
SECOND SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Wherefore? wherefore? : None
THIRD SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general, : None
4.5 :Caius Marcius. : None
FIRST SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Why do you say 'thwack our general '? : None
THIRD SERVINGMAN
4.5 :I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always : None
4.5 :good enough for him. : None
SECOND SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too : None
4.5 :hard for him; I have heard him say so himself. : None
FIRST SERVINGMAN
4.5 :He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth : None
4.5 :on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched : None
4.5 :him like a carbon ado. : None
SECOND SERVINGMAN
4.5 :An he had been cannibally given, he might have : None
4.5 :broiled and eaten him too. : None
FIRST SERVINGMAN
4.5 :But, more of thy news? : None
THIRD SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son : None
4.5 :and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no : None
4.5 :question asked him by any of the senators, but they : None
4.5 :stand bald before him: our general himself makes a : None
4.5 :mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and : None
4.5 :turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But : None
4.5 :the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i' : None
4.5 :the middle and but one half of what he was : None
4.5 :yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty : None
4.5 :and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says, : None
4.5 :and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he : None
4.5 :will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled. : None
SECOND SERVINGMAN
4.5 :And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine. : None
THIRD SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as : None
4.5 :many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it : None
4.5 :were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as : None
4.5 :we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude. : None
FIRST SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Directitude! what's that? : None
THIRD SERVINGMAN
4.5 :But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again, : None
4.5 :and the man in blood, they will out of their : None
4.5 :burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with : None
4.5 :him. : None
FIRST SERVINGMAN
4.5 :But when goes this forward? : None
THIRD SERVINGMAN
4.5 :To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the : None
4.5 :drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a : None
4.5 :parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they : None
4.5 :wipe their lips. : None
SECOND SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Why, then we shall have a stirring world again. : None
4.5 :This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase : None
4.5 :tailors, and breed ballad-makers. : None
FIRST SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as : None
4.5 :day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and : None
4.5 :full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy; : None
4.5 :mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more : None
4.5 :bastard children than war's a destroyer of men. : None
SECOND SERVINGMAN
4.5 :'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to : None
4.5 :be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a : None
4.5 :great maker of cuckolds. : None
FIRST SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Ay, and it makes men hate one another. : None
THIRD SERVINGMAN
4.5 :Reason; because they then less need one another. : None
4.5 :The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap : None
4.5 :as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising. : None

4.7 :Their talk at table, and their thanks at end; : None
4.7 :And you are darken'd in this action, sir, : None
4.7 :Even by your own. : None
AUFIDIUS
4.7 :                  I cannot help it now, : None
4.7 :Unless, by using means, I lame the foot : None
4.7 :Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier, : None
4.7 :Even to my person, than I thought he would : None
4.7 :When first I did embrace him: yet his nature : None
4.7 :In that's no changeling; and I must excuse : None
4.7 :What cannot be amended. : None
LIEUTENANT
4.7 :Yet I wish, sir,-- : None
4.7 :I mean for your particular,--you had not : None
4.7 :Join'd in commission with him; but either : None
4.7 :Had borne the action of yourself, or else : None
4.7 :To him had left it solely. : None
AUFIDIUS
4.7 :I understand thee well; and be thou sure, : None
4.7 :when he shall come to his account, he knows not : None
4.7 :What I can urge against him. Although it seems, : None
4.7 :And so he thinks, and is no less apparent : None
4.7 :To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly. : None
4.7 :And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state, : None
4.7 :Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon : None
4.7 :As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone : None
4.7 :That which shall break his neck or hazard mine, : None
4.7 :Whene'er we come to our account. : None
LIEUTENANT
4.7 :Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome? : None
AUFIDIUS
4.7 :All places yield to him ere he sits down; : None
4.7 :And the nobility of Rome are his: : None
4.7 :The senators and patricians love him too: : None
4.7 :The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people : None
4.7 :Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty : None
4.7 :To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome : None
4.7 :As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it : None
4.7 :By sovereignty of nature. First he was : None
4.7 :A noble servant to them; but he could not : None
4.7 :Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride, : None
4.7 :Which out of daily fortune ever taints : None
4.7 :The happy man; whether defect of judgment, : None
4.7 :To fail in the disposing of those chances : None
4.7 :Which he was lord of; or whether nature, : None
4.7 :Not to be other than one thing, not moving : None
4.7 :From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace : None
4.7 :Even with the same austerity and garb : None
4.7 :As he controll'd the war; but one of these-- : None
4.7 :As he hath spices of them all, not all, : None
4.7 :For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd, : None
4.7 :So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit, : None
4.7 :To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues : None
4.7 :Lie in the interpretation of the time: : None
4.7 :And power, unto itself most commendable, : None
4.7 :Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair : None
4.7 :To extol what it hath done. : None
4.7 :One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail; : None
4.7 :Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail. : None
4.7 :Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine, : None
4.7 :Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine. : None

COMINIUS
5.1 :I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon : None

MENENIUS
5.1 :Very well: : None
5.1 :Could he say less? : None
COMINIUS

MENENIUS
5.1 :For one poor grain or two! : None
5.1 :I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child, : None

SICINIUS
5.1 :Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid : None

MENENIUS
5.1 :Well, and say that Marcius : None
5.1 :Return me, as Cominius is return'd, : None
5.1 :Unheard; what then? : None
5.1 :But as a discontented friend, grief-shot : None
5.1 :With his unkindness? say't be so? : None
SICINIUS
5.1 :Yet your good will : None
5.1 :must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure : None
5.1 :As you intended well. : None
MENENIUS
5.1 :I'll undertake 't: : None
5.1 :I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip : None
5.1 :And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me. : None
5.1 :He was not taken well; he had not dined: : None
5.1 :The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then : None
5.1 :We pout upon the morning, are unapt : None

COMINIUS
5.1 :I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye : None
5.1 :Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury : None

FIRST SENATOR
5.2 :Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his : None

SECOND SENATOR

FIRST SENATOR
5.2 :You are a Roman, are you? : None
MENENIUS
5.2 :I am, as thy general is. : None
FIRST SENATOR

5.2 :thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's : None

5.2 :thee, I have been blown out of your gates with : None
5.2 :sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy : None
